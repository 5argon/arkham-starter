You can also pick them up for real when you succeed at the test instead of writing in the campaign log. (Plus you can clearly see which locations has stuff remaining without checking campaign log, in also Part II and Part III.) The backside contains a mini-sized proxy for dropped stuff while playing To the Forbidden Peaks, with reminder text that you need an action to pick each of them up. Players with small table might have trouble moving the asset back to the location with its uses remaining, while that location has tons of attachments, enemies, and investigator mini-cards. You can now instead move the asset to set-aside area and place these proxies on the location instead. When you have the asset on your play area, you can also attach these cards on them to remind other players that they can spend an action to take the asset from you, not just picking up from location.",

If you put down an arcane asset occupying one of the slot, overlay the top corner of that card over both the arcane icon and blue hand icon to represent that your extra hand had disappeared. Inversely, if you are going to play the 3rd Hand asset into your extra hand, overlay the top corner of that card such that it covers just the blue hand icon, but not the arcane icon.
