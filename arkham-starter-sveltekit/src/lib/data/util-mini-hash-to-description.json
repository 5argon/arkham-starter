    "description": "These are used to play a custom variant of Ice and Death (Part I) where you randomize which location you get in their same tier (same clue entry cost), and ignore location connection symbols. You can use them to randomly pick the original location card into play. (You now know what it is even before spending clue to enter, like the original Ice and Death.) You can also place the unknown side to place on the map so players don't know what they get until they spend clues and move in. The original Ice and Death locations doesn't come with unknown backside so you can't do this with just those cards. You need to save the map you got to play Part II and Part III, though. Maybe just take a photo of it. Make sure to completely randomize all remaining locations if you ended Part I without revealing all of them. In regular Ice and Death, these cards can be used to remember (maybe store with the player's deck) Revealed Locations in your campaign log without writing in the log."

    "description": "Put it on an enemy that got disabled by Cookie. The effect lasts til the end of round so this might be quite useful if you take turns engaging or dragging the disabled enemies around (especially in Resolute version where you could do the disable in someone else's turn). The backside just have different set icon just in case you use Resolute version and want a matching one."

    "description": "To the Forbidden Peaks and The Heart of Madness has a special action anyone could perform that is stated in the campaign book, instead of something like on Act / Agenda / Story card. Use this to make it more obvious to players. (And remind them what exactly the action does, like how many things you could give or take, or whether you can even take in from other players the first place.)"

    "description": "Make it looks more like enemy card template when rule says to treat it as if it is an enemy. When it collapses, you can take this card along with the damage counter to victory display so it is more obvious that other standing pylons still have this mini card on them. It also has a handy reminder which seal it corresponds to, and the backside that enlarge the game-wide benefit text for you if you managed to put a seal on it. (Sorry if this visual is a bit too over-the-top for you, but I forgot to apply the benefits too many times I need it to really kick my eyes amidst the sea of blue cards.)"

    "description": "Put it on a treachery that got disabled by Roald. The effect only lasts til the end of turn, you might not really need this one to remember the blanking, but I made it for completeness anyway. The backside just have different set icon just in case you use Resolute version and want a matching one."

    "hash": "EOTEC-Supplies",
    "description": "I think it is a shame that all recoverable supplies in Ice and Death all have artworks ready in To the Forbidden Peaks, though in this scenario you could see just a tiny text on location when you are going to pick them up. I understand that attaching To the Forbidden Peaks asset here 'just for show' would be a mess of ruling. So a custom mini-card like this is perfect to finally see them! You can also pick them up for real when you succeed at the test instead of writing in the campaign log. (Plus you can clearly see which locations has stuff remaining without checking campaign log, in also Part II and Part III.) The backside contains a mini-sized proxy for dropped stuff while playing To the Forbidden Peaks, with reminder text that you need an action to pick each of them up. Players with small table might have trouble moving the asset back to the location with its uses remaining, while that location has tons of attachments, enemies, and investigator mini-cards. You can now instead move the asset to set-aside area and place these proxies on the location instead. When you have the asset on your play area, you can also attach these cards on them to remind other players that they can spend an action to take the asset from you, not just picking up from location."

    "hash": "EOTEC-The Heart of Madness-Seal",
    "description": "This scenario's map is epic, but it also cause problem for some players sitting at awkward angle being too far from some locations to read. These essentially just enlarge the text on some key locations that you needs to go. Put them under the location cards with bottom side poking out. The backside has different text rotation so the enlargement is poking out from right side of the location instead."

  {
    "hash": "EOTEC-The Nameless Madness",
    "description": "I've had some fiddliness and visibility problem playing this scenario before. Printing whopping 15x of these gives you : 1. Horizontal mini-cards which save space and also might stands out more together with other blue enemies. 2. You can flip it to the backside when exhausting it instead of turning it sideways, which cause it to become black and white with red frame, making it more obvious where you could move without taking AoO in all the mess. Text is tiny and are there just for quick glance, you can instead read them more easily on the real card."

    "hash": "EOTEC-To the Forbidden Peaks-Level",
    "description": "I'm not doubting your ability to count numbers, but with small table or odd orientation you might not be able to arrange a proper mountain like the guide says. Level markers allow you to clump up locations differently where they might lose a bit of sense of height. Slide the card under the location with bottom edge visible. Use the backside if you want the number to poke out of right edge of the card instead."
