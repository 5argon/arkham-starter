# Making multiple cuts

We don't have luxury of real card cutting machine with its sharp punch exerting equal force at all points at once. With cutters, you have to weight between :

- Making multiple, less-forceful cuts. This give you neat edges, but if the 2nd or 3rd time you didn't go with exact angle of the knife, you might not land on exactly the same place. When this occurs, you may see visible waste of thin paper strips coming out.
- Making the fewest cuts possible with more force, but more force risks making some skips during the cut and this makes the edge fluff up.

If cutter is too angled to the ruler, you may also create a visible chamfered edge on thick paper like this. Though this is not a problem after you sleeve the divider.

# Ruler is a clamp

Good ruler makes straight cut, but great ruler **clamps** your work. It might not matter in thinner paper, but at 250~300 gsm, if ruler is not good enough on its contact with the paper and its length, it is possible for the cutter to dislocate the content you are cutting.

So getting a good ruler with big contact area and maybe anti-slip texture underneath is a must even if the price may surprised you.

A single slide ruin many adjacent cards on the sheet at once, and often even if one card is ruined, to make a replacement you can't easily remake just a single card and you ended up having to print a big sheet just to recover a few cards to make a complete set.

Mistake like this is costly and you rather spend them on the ruler that you can keep using.

Also make sure to distribute the weight well by pushing the paper near the center of mass of the remaining work to cut. Otherwise you might ended up creating a rotation point instead and ruin the cut anyway.

# Avoid noodles

An uncut sheet with edge guides is designed to cut the center content out without cutting all the way to the edge. So you must either cut vertically first or horizontally first.

To decide which side to go first, choose the side with bigger gaps between cuts. If you choose a side with small gaps, when you go make a perpendicular cut you will have to fight what I called "noodles". It is harder to clamp down these noodles and increase the risk that your cutter sliding the noodles and cause collateral damage.

# Flip ruler on the last cut of each side

If you just slide ruler along the way, the last cut is where ruler has insufficient contact area to clamp the work. You must switch your cutting position to the other side to make the final cut to make sure the ruler can grip your work well. This gets easier if you work on a table where you can walk around the work. (Like at the corner of table.)
