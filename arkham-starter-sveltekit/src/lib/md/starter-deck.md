# Starter Deck

These decks are curated from arkhamdb.com. Since majority of decks in that site are made by power users with access to every cards in the game, it is very common for a highly-rated deck there to touch only 1~4 cards in an entire Investigator Expansion to get the deck to do its best thing in any mulligan combination. Though that would perform well, in beginner's perspective it might appear as wasteful to buy such an expensive product for only a few cards, and the cost of building those decks appears insane.

Those who don't want to deckbuild and just want to go on an adventure might be led to think unless they buy more, they can't follow any deck. The ultimate objective of this page is to say that's not true!

Unlike arkhamdb, this site's decklist design has "expansion used" icon array displaying upfront so beginners can immediately see that the deck is cheap and buildable even before going into it. Each icon is one unit of purchase, so all the decks here will look immediately friendly for their low amount of icons. If using this display for decks in arkhamdb (you can try it by viewing a popular deck in arkhamdb, then modify URL from `arkhamdb.com` to `arkham-starter.com`), each deck can easily hit 8+ icons.

Each deck has a backlink to it to read the deck guide. There you can like the deck to show appreciation and can comment to talk with the author.

## Submit your starter decks

Are you a **starter deck author** looking to help out future AHLCG beginners? Such is the objective of this site! If your deck aligns with criterias below, direct message me on the contacts below with a URL to your **published** deck and I'll work on adding it to the site. Many combination of purchases are still missing at this point (e.g. Core + Dunwich + Carcosa which is quite a common sequence of purchase.) so this site could always use your help.

## What is a Starter Deck?

This site defined a "Starter Deck" as :

- **New distribution format** : First, it means each player having one copy of Revised Core Set. You should not ever assume player having only 1x Machete or 1x Deduction again. Such deck will be underpowered for modern new players buying Revised Core Set. Second, it means Investigator Expansion. If the player has Zoey Samaras, they also has Prepared for the Worst (that was originally given in one of the Mythos Pack.) 

  Finally, player always have the Revised-additional cards such as Lockpicks and Charisma. Make sure you are not unintentionally use the one from Investigator Expansion. For example, when making a deck not intended to require Dunwich Legacy but wants to use Charisma or Relic Hunter, in arkhamdb you need to unselect the entire The Dunwich Legacy checkboxes so it uses Revised Core Set's Charisma and Relic Hunter instead. Make sure it doesn't say "The Essex County Express" when you hover on them. Same for Lockpicks, arkhamdb seems to prioritize The Path to Carcosa ones rather than Revised Core Set.

- **No more than 3 additional purchases** : In new release format, Investigator Expansion and Investigator Starter Deck counts as 1 unit of purchase. This site wants to show that the options expanded by a lot when player clicks on even one additional expansions. Since Parallel Investigator are all free to print and play, they are always available for use without taking this quota.
- **0 XP Deck with Side Deck as upgrades** : Beginners can't easily work backwards from full XP deck to 0 XP deck to start playing like intermediate players. Rather we would like them able to gather all the cards listed and being able to just sit and play for an entire campaign without touching the collection box again. They can still make choices of upgrade decisions from cards in the Side Deck. You are not required to eventually purchase everything in the Side Deck.

  Note that in arkhamdb Side Deck cards neither contribute towards packs required nor being searchable. In this site, Side Deck are treated importantly as real, required cards to build the deck (since they are the future state of the deck), and are compatible with filters that let you look for decks using cards you are interested in (in the future).

- **For Standard difficulty** : Though it is generally advised that newcomers to play on Easy, all the deck in this site should be Standard compatible. If they decided to play on Easy anyway then the deck will be even performing better than expected. It means that the investigator is able to use their dominant stats to win tests on Standard difficulty after setting up appropriately. (e.g. Someone with 3 stat wouldn't able to do much on Standard without boosts or commits, but would be able to in Easy.)
- **Has a deck guide** : Put this guide in the Description section. It is a good idea to explain how to play at various XP point this deck would journey through. Upgrade guide, what to look for in mulligans, and so on. If you are feeling generous, how to play the investigator here and there would help. (e.g. In Wendy deck, it'd be helpful to remind readers about her token redraw ability at various point in the guide.)

## New Metadata

These decks can use special fields that arkhamdb doesn't support.

- **Excerpt** : You are able to add about 250 characters text-only short description that would get shown in the listing, instead of requiring user to take a look inside.
- **Optional/suggested cards** : You can flag some cards in Side Deck as optional. Those cards will be separated to a new section below Side Deck to show that they are not strictly needed to progress the deck but would be nice to have. They will not contribute towards the 3 purchases quota. For example, you can have "Double, Double" as an optional card in Sefina deck while preventing The Circle Undone Investigator Expansion to appear as a requirement since you are only suggesting this 1 card from an entire box.
- **Series** : If you are making a deck as a series, you can specify series' name of your deck. Multiple decks of the same series could get linked to each other, improving discoverability. (In the future.)
- **Modified name** : You can use different name than what you use in arkhamdb. arkhamdb has no organization so people often put series name in the deck's title. For example, my decks in arkhamdb always have "2 Packs Deck Guide :" prefix that I would like to remove here since the fact that it uses 2 packs are obvious in the UI.

<!-- - **Tag** : You can tag your deck what it is dealing with. In the future user can look for a missing role to fill their team with the filter. Each tag supports a short explanation (~100 characters) why it is able to fill that role, and a flag whether it is the deck's main role (can do with high success rate, has acceleration) or off-role (can do sometimes, can't do alone).

### Available Tags

- **Fight** : Use Fight action to deal damage to enemies.
- **Evade** : Use Evade action to exhaust enemies.
- **Investigate** : Can pick up clues from location consistently.
- **Treachery** : Deal with various kind of treacheries. (Commit, cancel, ignore, discard.)
- **Heal** : Can remove damage / horror counters from investigators.
- **Support** : Has something not related to treachery and healing that affects other investigator. For example Minh and Carson would always have a Teamplay role from their ability. Teamwork, Encyclopedia, Stand Together, Extra Ammunition, etc. all also works targeting other investigators. -->
