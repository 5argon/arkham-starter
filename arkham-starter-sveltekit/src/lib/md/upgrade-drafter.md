# Upgrade Drafter

By picking 1 investigator and packs you own, it would show you 1 XP+ cards that that investigator can use. It can either show all of them or randomizes a set amount.

- For beginners with 0 XP deck wanted to spend XP for something cool rather than having to look at intimidating size of the collection. The drafted result allows "window shopping" of upgrade cards. This is ideal on the transition of The Gathering to The Midnight Masks, on a game you are teaching newcomers, for example. So they can still feel like they are growing the investigator themselve picking from some limited choices.
- For players looking for challenges only choosing randomized upgrades as they play without any prior upgrade plans.

## Features

- XP filter : Ideal when you have limited XP left, and you want to find something cheap to splurge on. (Before campaign ends, etc.)
- Redraw : When randomized result show you an upgrade that you don't like (e.g. Lower XP version of what you have now in the deck.), you can re-pick an individual card, and it prevents getting the same card as your other existing draws.
