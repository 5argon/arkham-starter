# Explore

This tool is like a lite version of https://arkhamdb.com/search or https://arkhamdb.com/find, which means it has less extensive query capability. Instead, I focus on beginner friendliness.

The URL "explore" means it is mainly to leisurely finding ideas from viewing cards laid out before you, like looking at a physical collection. So objective-wise it is different from arkhamdb.com's "search".

- I don't want it to feel technical to new players, so **card scans** is the default view. New player should just see the card. It never show card's text, or any digitized information about the card. (Such as skill icons, cost, etc.) User is required to look at the card graphics themself.
- Other view option may exist, such as table formatted compact list that the column maybe able to show some of the card's information.
- There is no text query language like `p:2 k:Tactic` in arkhamdb.com. Everything must be done by the toolbar instead. This reduces flexibility, but verboseness make it easy for beginners. (Such as seeing a toolbar of pack icons to click on.)
- Card results change **instantly** as user change the criteria, and there is no pagination of returned results. This point is important, I want beginners feel like they are sifting through physical cards instead of asking the server by query.
