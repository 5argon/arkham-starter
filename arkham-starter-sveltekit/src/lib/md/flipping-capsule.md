# Flipping Capsule

This game can get pretty creative with effects sometimes. There are effects with on-off (boolean) bookkeeping aspect (like exhausting a card do to help you remember you had used it) that the playfield cannot record for you.

I bought a pack of cheap 25 mm coin capsule for the chaos tokens already, and there are still some left. The leftover are perfect to act as boolean state indicator by pasting differently colored stickers on each side. Just make sure you know intuitively which one is OFF or ON. I think grey is a pretty universal color that meant OFF, like a disabled button. The other side can use other colors.

I name these thing "flipping capsule", an ON/OFF state indicator (like the clue/doom token) that I found quite useful. This page explain different situations these capsules can be use, and how many to make.

## Buying list

Take 27 clear coin capsules leftover from blinging the chaos tokens.

Buy circular sticker sheets of white, grey, and 5 colors matching each class, totalling 7 sheets.

I would choose the size of sticker around 20-23 mm diameter so it fits on my 25 mm coin capsule with some room to spare. Try to get PVC material so it resists water if you play with drinks. One sheet of sticker should have a ton, much more than we need. Since we are making 27 capsules, it should be more than 27 stickers per sheet (likely). Grey is the OFF state of all capsules, so actually the grey sheet needs 27 stickers. The other colors need much less.

## Paste the stickers

Paste grey on one side of all 27 capsules. Then on the other side :

- 12 white. Left these white blank.
- 5 white, write on both grey and white side with a permanent pen : +2, and the 4 skill test icons.
- Each class color gets 2 capsules, total to 10. Not recommended to draw the class icons on them, sometimes we use these for another purpose so best to keep it abstract.

They are ready now!

## Example usages

### Class State

An on-off for each class in the game.

- Minh Thi Phan : Represent each investigator in the team and flip to remember whether you had given wild icon to that member this round or not.
- Lola Hayes : Represent your role. Have only one as ON to specify currently active role. If everything are OFF, you are in neutral role.

### Action / Additional Action

Beginners often need the 3 action counters to help learning the game in NotZ. But even experienced players trip up when Mythos Phase removes some of your actions, but the phase was too long you forgot that. And you don't want to take the encounter card as a reminder as the desk is already crowded with cards, and that also make encounter discard ordering wrong when you put back. You want something different from cards. Sometimes Rogue loves to take action as if it is their turn, then by the time it came back you forgot how many actions you used. And also Act advancement with lengthy effect as well.

So I use white/grey for the action. This is why I made 12 white/grey, just in case there are 4 players and each one wants the counter.

Additional action uses one of the class colored capsule, which by the game rule must be spent first if possible, so it can teach beginners visually about this as well as they flip away the capsule before doing something. Something like Police Badge gives 2 additional actions, so this is why I made 2 each of the class capsules.

Additional action token can be used such as :

- Leo De Luca
- "Skids" O'Toole
- Daisy Walker
- Police Badge
- Quick Thinking
- .41 Derringer (2)
- Finn Edwards
- Tony Morgan
- Luke Robinson
- Bob Jenkins
- Carson Sinclair

### Reaction Trigger Limit

For "Limit once per ..." on the investigator card and you don't want to turn around the investigator card (like exhaust) to remember this. If per phase, flip back whenever it gets to the next phase.

Example :

- Roland Banks
- Agnes Baker
- Rex Murphy (Taboo)
- Mark Harrigan
- William Yorick
- Ursula Downs
- Father Mateo
- Diana Stanley
- Rita Young
- Mandy Thompson
- Trish Scarborough
- Silas Marsh
- Amina Zidane

### Free Trigger Limit

For "Limit once per ..." on the investigator card and you don't want to turn around the investigator card (like exhaust) to remember this. If per phase, flip back whenever it gets to the next phase.

Example :

- "Skids" O'Toole
- "Ashcan" Pete
- Lola Hayes
- Dexter Drake

### Action Trigger Limit

For "Limit once per ..." on the investigator card and you don't want to turn around the investigator card (like exhaust) to remember this. If per phase, flip back whenever it gets to the next phase.

Example :

- Bonesaw

### Action limit

When you can only do something once per round but not the other thing, colored capsules can be useful.

- Parallel Roland's Discipline : Many prevent you to do something more than twice per round, you can take the colored class capsules to flip each time you do something. Yet another reason to make 2 of each.

### +2

Remember the "next test" temporary boost, or any other longer transparent +2 boosts. You can flip back to make the boost expire.

- Fieldwork
- Narrow Escape

### Stat capsules

Currently I use it for : 

- Encyclopedia : Give the capsule with the right icon to whom you boost.
- Making Preparation : The boost stat get the white side of stat capsule, the reduce stat gets the grey side.
- Hyperphysical Shotcaster : Remember the current form : attack (fist), investigate (book), evade (feet). Use willpower, or colored one for whatever.

## Replenishing uses

Though the game tell you to use resource tokens, more than once I bump the tokens and it mixed up with real resources nearby. I also tried using colored wooden cube, but the "off" state is not intuitive. I put the cube off to the side the card so it meant off, and put back on the card to meant on. Now again I often bump the cube and not sure how many were off or on. Using resource token also requires putting them in the bank and back each round.

Unlike regular uses that I use numbered dice and it only keeps going down in most case, replenishing uses often go up and down, making the dice also annoying to maintain.

The solution is I need something to flip. The capsules are handy again! Example of cards that can use some help :

- Arcane Studies (4)
- Dig Deep (4)
- Hard Knocks (4)
- Hyperawareness (4)
- Physical Training (4)
- Bruiser
- Crafty
- Prophetic
- Sleuth
- Antiquary
- Runic Axe
- True Magick (Though you can just exhaust it.)
