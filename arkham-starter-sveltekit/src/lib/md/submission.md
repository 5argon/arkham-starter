# A note on static nature of this site

Unlike arkhamdb.com which has a server that keeps generating pages for the visitor, this site's quirk is that its server is **static**, it can't generate pages, it just serve **existing pages** it knows beforehand. This make the pages served extremely fast even when using mobile phone. However, it compromises some tricks that regular site can use. In arkhamdb.com, notice how you can build a new deck and you instantly got a new page to share. That's **dynamic** website where the server can generate new pages on the fly.

That means new starter decks here cannot appear on the site unless I manually press "build" the site, on my laptop, after adding new decks. While this looks so prehistoric, but I expect not too many authors loves to make "starter decks" that often (as evidenced by all the min-maxed decks worth many hundred of dollars in arkhamdb.com), so I think it is a reasonable path for this site. In exchange, we get insane page serving speed and low hosting cost for me.

For this early version, I will personally contacting multiple deck authors I currently know for the inclusion of their decks, then I hand-input those decks. So if you want your starter decks in here, please let me know manually.

# What is a Starter Deck

All decks on arkham-starter.com is a **subset of** decks in arkhamdb.com. Each entry also links to the original deck at arkhamdb.com instead of outright copying it. So this site works like an aggregator, viewers are still forwarded to the original page so that the author could receive comments and likes.

Cards used these decks are saved in this site, which sometimes it uses for searching / filtering purpose or sometimes briefly let you peek at the cards. But it will not put effort in actually displaying the Description section and other toolings such as card draw simulator. The site very much expecting viewer to follow the link to your original arkhamdb.com page to do stuff.

However, there are several restrictions that qualifies a deck for this site, otherwise this site would be identical to arkhamdb.com! The name "starter" is intended that these decks are all a "starter deck", meaning that they are :

## Economical

It must limits amount of purchases, regarding the repackaged format. It make use of what's available to the fullest as opposed to picking the best pieces from across an entire collections. Right now, a unit of purchase is Revised Core Set, Investigator Expansion box, and the Starter Deck. We don't think about old Mythos Packs in this site. More details about this below how many packs can you use.

## Guided

Decks in arkhamdb.com are very brief in explaining how to play the deck as the author assumes player looking at the decklist and know what combos are available, and know what to do for any combination that they draw. Especially if there are fan favorite cards among them that defines the play style.

That does not work for beginners that do not even know effects of each card. Decks here must put more effort in writing a guide such that even a complete beginner (that know basic rules) can play the deck, and can look out for the hot stuff inside the deck. More obscure rules that is related to the function of the deck must be explained in the deck guide.

## Main Deck 0 XP : Ready to start a campaign with

In arkhamdb.com, there are many decks that lists the final state. **Beginners cannot reverse engineer these decks on their own** how would the 0 XP version looks like.

- We enforce a rule that the starting deck must require 0 XP, or exactly the bonus XP that the investigator or some cards like In The Thick Of It could provide.
- Then, the **Side Deck** section is used to hold all the upgrade cards, or alternative 0 XP cards to swap depending on what you said in the Description section. Which card to remove when upgrading the deck is expressed separately with the attached upgrade guide in the Description section.
- Any card you mentioned in the Description as upgrades or variations, they should all exist in the Side Deck. Otherwise the deck gather tool cannot take account of those cards.
- It is possible to submit a 0 XP only deck, with empty Side Deck, and the Description tells the player to think for themselve. But this is not very recommended.

The point is that if beginners gathers all these cards before beginning scenario 1, they should not have to go back to their collection until the end of campaign. All the options are in the Side Deck already.

Avoid using the per-scenario upgrade feature of arkhamdb.com, since it locks in how many XP the player get on each scenario. That feature is for an on-going deck currently used in a campaing. New player may feel bad if they could not match the pace. A general upgrade guide that also let the player think and modify for themselves is better.

## Standard difficulty compatible

You only need to account your deck to have good time (does not equal "100% winning") on Standard campaign. You don't have to think about having enough boost for Hard difficulty.

In contrary, if the deck only could perform on Easy, I think it is not good enough. (Perhaps the deck is highly thematic it sacrifices too much of the consistency to win Standard.) Beginners still should play on Easy, but having Standard-compatible decks in the first place will provide room to account for sloppy plays even if they are on Easy.

All this is in the context that **Taboo is ON**. See more about Taboo below.

Meme decks or thematic decks are allowed as long as they are able to be enjoyed on Standard campaign. A deck such as one [designed to kill yourself](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40073/farewell-skids-2.0) probably does not belong to this site, even if it uses limited amount of packs.

## Low overlaps is NOT required

You can take any cards you have in your pack restriction to the fullest. Decks intended to clash less definitely has better value (e.g. If Ashcan Pete takes 2x Deduction and 2x Vicious Blow all for his dog, it might makes some decks in the team "angry"), but this site is looking to provide overlap resolution tools to the viewer depending on the assembled team, and likely can find a match even if a deck hogs all the popular cards. Go ahead!

**However**, if you managed to make your series of decks having low or even no overlaps between each others, the overlap resolution tool I mentioned would be able to **reward** your hardwork handsomely! Basically, it can sort the team composition that has less overlaps up top and it becomes more likely that visitor pairs your deck with your other decks.

## Taboo is ON

Though it is generally recommended that beginners should ignore Taboo, we would like to make a deck **still playable** if this player decided to step up to the challenge. Turning Taboo from ON to OFF usually will not break things, but the reverse is not true.

For example, if you build a deck with **no** Taboo Milan in mind, you can get away with a lot of high cost attack events and with little Skill card, and you can breeze through Standard. The moment player decided to adopt Taboo, this deck is no longer fun to play as you can't play most of the cards at will. Rather, you should have a deck healthy in cost and has balanced Skill cards diet in the first place that player don't have to modify the deck to play with Taboo.

This applies to heavily chained cards like Higher Education and Streetwise. Building with Taboo off, your Side Deck maybe full of wonderful stuff to purchase. The moment player decided to play with Taboo, they are no longer obtainable before the end of campaign they started not looking like the same deck anymore.

Inversely, Taboo can sometimes affects the deck positively, such as Springfield's ranged attack property or Ritual Candle's ability to activate on any symbol. You are able to submit a deck that works **only if Taboo is on**. (e.g. A Springfield deck, with a lot of movement cards to make the Taboo'ed ranged attack works.)

## Standalone breakpoint is recommended

Since the deck is forced to be 0 XP and have upgrade cards in the Side Deck, it is the best if player can follow your Description section and clearly see the progression, that they know where to stop if the deck is at 9 XP, 19 XP, or 29 XP. (And decide at which point the deck starts to function as intended. Is 29 XP too much, or required?)

## Not for any particular campaign

While it is good to take account of the campaign of the same expansion as the character, (e.g. Low XP to get going for Dunwich character decks, since Dunwich campaign gives low XP.) it should not be so much that the deck description telling what the player should do on each scenario of the campaign and which path to take. The deck should be usable for any campaign, especially that now we can buy Campaign Expansion separately.

# Additional Metadata

arkhamdb.com's deck could use more side data attached to a deck to help newbies assemble their team. As a result I require additional information attached to each of your deck.

## 1. Primary Role

Help beginner find the right fit into a team, especially for Rogue, Mystic, and Survivor.

One deck can be a bit of everything, so the keyword here is "primary". There are 3 exclusive options. Choose between "Enemy", "Clue", or "Flex".

- "Enemy" : Can actually fight to kill it away or actively managing it via evasion or making it disappear. If it is a Seeker that happened to be able to evade sometimes, probably the primary role is "Clue". "Enemy" also includes helps the other members defending from them.
- "Clue" : Good at getting clues, or make the problem disappear in order to continue getting clues. A good criteria is that the deck thinks "a piece of cake" to see 2 shroud, "happy to work on" 3 shroud, and "ok" to 4 shroud. (Standard difficulty) Remember that a Seeker may have enemy management cards, but that is likely not their primary role.
- "Flex" : Only choose this if you think **beginners** can shapeshift, use the deck **as either role**, depending on what they happened to draw in that scenario. Like a Mystic deck with equal Shrivelling + Rite of Seeking plus some willpower boosters. If it only has a spinkle of Evidence! or similar, probably it only offer "some help" to clue finding instead of worthy to be called a flexible investigator. A deck with Flashlight + Lockpicks together with some guns look more like a flex. **Flex** deck implies it **can true-solo** to a degree that a player can have fun in Easy and sometimes on Standard if they are lucky. (OK to have trouble to actually win a campaign, this game is hard.) There is no "Solo" tag to specify.

First and foremost you are the judge of your own deck even though I may disagree. If you still think your Guardian deck with just Evidence! or Seeker deck with just Mind Over Matter is a "Flex" from beginners viewpoint, I will respect your judgement.

## 2. Excerpt

This site contains a new **excerpt** feature as a short blurbs about the deck, so you don't have to try putting all the advertisement on the deck's name. It should get the viewer excited to go to your original page at arkhamdb.com.

I will try to extract the excerpt from your Description, but **you can provide me a custom one in the submission email**. The limit is **1 line**. (around 100 characters please) I design my UI around this length. Only plain text, it cannot show Emoji.

## 3. Three representative cards

Beginners like graphical stuff, and completely textual format like in arkhamdb.com is intimidating. You can choose any 3 cards from your deck (main or Side Deck) that you think you would like to show to your potential customer, and they will be shown in that order you choose. Most of the time you can choose some high XP cards in the plan, but 0 XP cards that are critical to the deck are also good choice, like those inside your limited splash cards quota.

If you made a deck using very unpopular card, showing that will surely get some attention. This encourages deck author to use unconventional cards as well as being a cool graphics for your deck entry.

You must select 3 cards even if you have less you want to show. The UI is designed that way.

## 4. Series

This site can group multiple decks in your personal folder of sorts. If there is an author profile page implemented, then viewers will have better control to browse your decks.

You can specify in your submission the series's name, and which decks of yours are supposed to be in it.

## 5. Deck renames

arkhamdb.com provide little tool to showcase your decks, this result in deck authors having to put a lot of stuff packed in the deck's name. (Such as "Deck Guide")

When you submit a deck, you have an opportunity to rename it to something succint if you want, now that we already have these restrictions and new UI in place. Note that this site is able to show packs used correctly in Investigator Expansion purchase unit, along with allowing you to put your decks in the same "series". There is no need to try encode those in the deck's name anymore.

# Pack Restriction

Any deck can use Revised Core Set. Then we think about Investigator Expansion as a unit of purchase. It could use **up to 2 Investigator Expansion boxes**. (This includes the expansion that gives the investigator card of that deck.) Optionally, it could opt in to use **1 Investigator Starter Deck** (Nathaniel Cho, Harvey Walters, ...).

Therefore, we have ensured that about 120$ spent (already a lot) will be able to build a team of entirely starter decks from this site. I want to give newcomers this insurance. The main draw of all the decks here is that the cards you own are valuable and get the job done with the right deck and guidance.

Return To product are not eligible for use, as they are not economical.

The browsing page, filtering, searching, and structure of this site are optimized for this restriction. For example, starting from any deck, you can search for an another deck to play together that does not require any additional purchases and has no overlapping cards.

## Parallel Investigator

Parallel Investigators front/back and/or their Advanced cards can be used freely, not counting to the 2 Investigator Expansions + 1 Starter Deck quota.

You may argue that parallels are tricky and not exactly beginner friendly, however because they are free to print and play, I value the fact that parallels multiply value of what you already have more. They likely making new players with limited fund very happy.

Advanced cards should be added to the Side Deck to let player know the deck is good with an Advanced version. Player can still choose to believe you or not if they don't want an Advanced one. (arkhamdb.com fixes the standard signature cards in the decks, you cannot take that out and add Advanced version in their place.)

In contrary, if the Advanced cards are not in the Side Deck, then you have communicated to the player that Advanced may cause more harm than good for this deck, even though it uses Parallel front/back.

## Utilization Density

Each deck will receive a "Utilization Density" display how many cards from the expansions are used, such as "[Core Icon] 23, [Dunwich Icon] 7". The pack icons let the player glance what purchases this deck requires ("how expensive is this deck"). The count number looks like they are just for show, but actually it can roughly say would a certain deck would overlap more or less with an another deck before even see the cards.

It also discourages you from including an expansion just to use a few cards. Imagine a deck with Winifred Habbamock icon, and a number 2 near it. (Likely Chuck Fergus or Lucky Cigarette Case) Beginners would not want to spend money just to take out 2 cards to build this deck. The more number below each pack icon, the more "impressive" the deck is in this site, it is **not all about performance**.

## The Hidden Category Labels (WIP Feature)

To highlight this system even more, each deck will receive a **hidden category label** :

- `1` : Using only Revised Core Set.
- `1S` : Revised Core Set + 1 Starter Deck.
- `2` : Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion.
- `2S` : Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion + 1 Starter Deck.
- `3` : Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansions.
- `3S` : Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansions + 1 Starter Deck.

The UI will display something more human than these cryptic `2S` for beginners. This is just for your understanding.

These labels have their use when the player is just starting out. For example, viewers that just bought a Revised Core Set may filter with `1` to find what to play, then maybe take a peek at `2` option to browse what decks are available to play if they buy which Investigator Expansion box next, without any Starter Deck in the equation.

These labels also encourage deck creator to not "waste" a pack's inclusion, for example, using only a few good cards from a Starter Deck, since that would cause the badge to gain `S` suffix. From deck creator's standpoint this optimizes the deck, but for beginner's standpoint it meant he must additionally buy a Starter Deck in order to complete this deck's missing piece, making the game more costly to start. I want to encourage buying Campaign Expansions rather tha player cards.

# Deck Guide

Human (me) will take a look at your Description section if it is sufficient or not. But don't fret, I essentially give everything as little as a few paragraphs a pass. Pack restriction is more important and more rigidly enforced. Only an extremely offensive Description section may be rejected...

# Investigator-specific information

There is a (quite) smart code that read your decklist and prop up the deck with **investigator-specific** information. Such as distribution of card classes in the deck, or choice you made for the deckbuilding restriction such as the subclass. You don't have to manually specify anything about this.
