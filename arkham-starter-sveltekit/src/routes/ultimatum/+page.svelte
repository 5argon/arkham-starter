<p>
	The FAQ version 2.3 ("The Midwinter Gala Edition") comes with explanation about Ultimatums and
	Boons which are essentially optional buffs and nerfs that are officially defined. So when you
	found the game too easy or too hard, you can apply some designer-guided adjustments.
</p>

<p>
	Refractions are scenario or campaign specific version of Ultimatums and Boons. It is a bit
	inconvenient to consult FAQ every time to check what are available to toggle on-off before you
	begin the campaign or scenario. Many of them also constantly modify scenario cards from what they
	are physically printed, so digital Refractions require players to remember the changes.
</p>

<p>
	I made these cards so they can be stored in the same box as the scenario or campaign, so you see
	them whenever you fancy playing that campaign again in the future, and perhaps tempt you to "pick"
	a challenge physically as they are laid on the table. (Like rogue-like games that show you talents
	in form of cards and they look interesting that way.) The edits that the Refraction cause are also
	more visible in a form of individual card to prevent misplays, just like many official
	back-of-Act/Agenda effects can stay on the table to be used as a reminder.
</p>

<p>
	Graphic includes bleed area. See the preview image above how much to cut out. (The throwing stars
	thing should be at around the edge.) They are color coded according to whether they are Ultimatums
	or Boons.

	The FAQ also talked about making your own Ultimatums and Boons. I also exported some empty card
	frames for that as well if you want to materialize your personal Ultimatums and Boons.
