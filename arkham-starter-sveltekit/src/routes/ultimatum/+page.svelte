	The <a
		href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2024/10/23/questions-and-ultimatums/"
		target="_blank">FAQ version 2.3 ("The Midwinter Gala Edition")</a
	> comes with explanation about Ultimatums and Boons which are essentially optional buffs and nerfs
	that are officially defined. So when you found the game too easy or too hard, you can apply some designer-guided
	adjustments.
</p>

<p>
	Refractions are scenario or campaign specific version of Ultimatums and Boons. It is a bit
	inconvenient to consult FAQ every time to check what are available to toggle on-off before you
	begin the campaign or scenario. Many of them also constantly modify scenario cards from what they
	are physically printed, so digital Refractions require players to remember the changes.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you might see where I'm going now. I made these cards so they can be stored in the
	same box as the scenario or campaign. You probably forget what Refractions are available for a
	particular campaign if you have not played it for some time. Now they are already waiting in the
	box.
</p>

<p>
	The modifications that the Ultimatums and Boons perform are also more visible in a form of
	individual card to prevent misplays, just like those back-of-Act/Agenda effects staying on the
	table to be used as a reminder. As an individual card, you can point to "that" Ultimatum or pass
	it around without recalling the name. You can shuffle them to randomize. You want to break the
	rule and give the Boon card to only one player having trouble. Maybe you are making online content
	and want viewers to look graphic instead of a FAQ entry when talking about what Ultimatums you
	choose. I said all that reasons, but maybe you simply want more blings...
</p>

<p>
	Graphic includes bleed area. See the preview image above how much to cut out. (The throwing stars
	thing should be at around the edge.) They are color coded according to whether they are Ultimatums
	or Boons. Some printing system supports only standard size card (MTG size), but AHLCG cards are a
	little bit narrower. With large bleed available you can cut out as much as you want to suit how
	your print shop works.

<p>
	These are printer-ready files in A4 size. Downside is that I packed in all the cards you may not
	want, but they do make exactly 4 sheets of A4 currently. Margin is rather small but if your
	printer can't handle this, you still have a bit of bleed for the printer to eats into before
	getting to the actual card. (Though you will lose the cut guide, in that case you can edit the
	image so cut lines are drawn across the sheet.)

	These are no bleed version, cut to MTG card aspect ratio. Intended for digital content creation.

<p>
	The FAQ also talked about making your own Ultimatums and Boons. I also exported some empty card
	frames for that as well if you want to materialize your personal Ultimatums and Boons.
