<p>
	This game generally did great job utilizing everything in the box to represent states on the
	table. Committed cards are there to count the icons after pulling the token. Exhausted cards are
	tapped. Event and treachery can become attachment (to even Act or Agenda) and retain their text
	box to read. Resources are being used as many kind of counters. Clues are sometimes for the
	enemies and doom are sometimes what you want. Chaos tokens gets onto play area with Seal
	mechanics. Even damage and horror tokens are utilized to represent states of the location!
</p>

<p>
	But players do also fill in some lacking area like location connectors and action counters on
	their investigator dashboard. Or even try to bling their game to use different tokens when the
	game asked for you to reuse core set tokens as something else. These are that kind of thing in
	mini-card format. When we could print whatever we want on paper, it gets quite to-the-point what
	it supposed to help compared to using abstract thing like a colored wooden cube.

			Inside folders : Horizontal mini-card graphics with bleed, and with further white area
			containing cut lines to cut the bleeds out.
		</li>
		<li>
			_mpc.zip : Still with bleed, but without the white area and cut lines, rotated to vertical
			orientation differently depending on sides. These should be compatible to print on mini-card
			size with MPC.
