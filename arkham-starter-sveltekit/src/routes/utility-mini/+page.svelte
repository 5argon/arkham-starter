<p>
	This game generally did great job utilizing everything in the box to represent states on the
	table. Committed cards are there to count the icons after pulling the token. Exhausted cards are
	tapped. Event and treachery can become attachment (to even Act or Agenda) and retain their text
	box to read. Resources are being used as many kind of counters. Clues are sometimes for the
	enemies and doom are sometimes what you want. Chaos tokens gets onto play area with Seal
	mechanics. Even damage and horror tokens are utilized to represent states of the location!
</p>

<p>
	Players do also fill in some lacking area like location connectors and action counters on their
	investigator dashboard. Or even try to bling their game to use different tokens when the game
	asked for you to reuse core set tokens as something else. This also has benefit of improving
	clarity, preventing the same kind of tokens with different meaning mixing up on busy table. Ever
	knocked ammo on your gun to your actual resource pool?
</p>

<p>
	But... this is a game that is not afraid to push the limits. Many times, the effect that designer
	wants is just "there", without any physical representation. For example, treachery that cause the
	player to lose action (this turn or in their next turn), or a single stat buff with defined expiry
	moment like Encyclopedia (2).
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes they are simple to play along, but in bigger player count Mythos Phase might be really
	long, and a single Agenda or Act advancement causes tons of story to unfold... by the time you get
	to Investigation Phase, can you still remember that you are supposed to have one or two less
	action, cannot move from your current location, or if which enemy has boosted stats?
</p>

<p>
	You maybe thinking of leaving the card on the table as a reminder and only discard when the effect
	is irrelevant. But doing so can cause more problems to cards that expecting something in the
	treachery discard pile, even in some specific order.
</p>

<p>
	I call such invisible states "Transient State". These "Utility Mini-Cards" materialize those
	states on your table, like digital games that could shows status icons of everything with no
	limits since they can make pixels do whatever they want. The table gets a bit busier and you need
	more storage for them, but I'd rather have lighter mental load and smoother gameplay. (Especially
	not to make misplays that makes the game easier for the investigators!).
</p>

<p>
	<b>These are subjective</b>. Sometimes they are not even representing transient states and just
	emphasize some text you can already see but I made mistakes of not seeing them before. On the
	other hand, some are transient states but I had no problem playing with them so I didn't make any
	card for them. (e.g. Fieldwork, Narrow Escape, Fight or Flight.) Choose just what you need help.
</p>

<p>
	The project is on-going, I can't remember all the misplay points in campaigns I haven't played for
	a while. I'll gradually add more as I replay campaigns and player cards.

	supposed to do and how many copies I think you need.
