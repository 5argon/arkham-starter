<p>
	This site ultimately aims to get you <i>start</i> playing Arkham Horror: The Card Game with less friction.
	That includes the performance of this site itself. It's designed to be very fast to load.
</p>

<p>
	Bigger part of the site is to provide some starter decks (cheaper decks using only a few
	expansions, no matter which one you go for first), and a party assembler that helps you avoid
	overlapping cards between team members. Right now this part is <b>in development</b>.
</p>

<p>
	What's ready to use right now are some beginner-oriented resources and helping tools. Take a look
	at them below!
