	I'm moving the hosting of dividers to Google Drive. There you could batch download the whole
	folder easier with the right click menu. You can also switch from list view to thumbnail view.

<p>
	Instead of picking individual graphics, these are PDF files with graphics already laid out and cut
	lines extended to the paper's edge. When print shop see this file, they will be happy as layout
	work is saved for them, and likely willing to cut them for you since the cut lines are there.
</p>

<p>
	The disadvantage is that I cannot maintain this for all languages, you might not want all of what
	I decided to pack in, and also paper size is locked to A4. This make it inefficient for print shop
	that can print larger size to fit more dividers.
