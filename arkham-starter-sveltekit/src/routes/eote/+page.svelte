<p>
	In the Prologue of Edge of the Earth, the campaign guide asks you to introduce expedition members
	by showing their card as you read to your group. However the length of that prologue might be time
	prohibitive for your meetup, you might want to do the prologue separately / online (using online
	PDF of the guide, or ArkhamCards app) instead so you could arrive and start the 1st scenario
	immediately.
</p>

<p>
	But that way, none other than collection owner could see the expedition members as they are
	introduced. This page is a solution to that problem so everyone can see them online as they read.
