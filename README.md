# arkham-starters.com

A repository for https://arkham-starters.com. Currently I don't have much confidence in project structure and have name/put files in messy place with little to no comments. It is likely just a project storage for now and not ready for you to read the code and contribute yet.

However, feel free to use Issue section if you found any bugs within the site as a user.

(If you managed to understand the project even in this messy state, contributions are welcomed!)

## What is this site

https://arkhambeginners.com is a static, curated decklist site with data pulled from ArkhamDB (https://arkhamdb.com). It is intended to be a go-to site for **beginners** to the series to easily find decks they could possibly build, to start playing as soon as possible, as opposed to browsing full wealth of decks and knowledges in ArkhamDB which maybe too intimidating.

The design will heavily encourage viewer to visit the original ArkhamDB deck page, so the author can still receive comments and likes where they are tracked. This site cannot track any changing data.

To reduce confusion, it is based on new release format starting from Revised Core Set and 2-box format expansions, along with all the repackaged expansions. It act as if the original Core Set doesn't exist, and there is no individual Mythos Pack.
