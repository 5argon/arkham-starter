# arkhambeginners.com

https://arkhambeginners.com is a static, curated decklist site with data pulled from ArkhamDB (https://arkhamdb.com). It is intended to be a go-to site for **beginners** to the series to easily find decks they could possibly build, to start playing as soon as possible, as opposed to browsing full wealth of decks and knowledges in ArkhamDB which maybe too intimidating.

The design will heavily encourage viewer to visit the original ArkhamDB deck page, so the author can still receive comments and likes where they are tracked. This site cannot track any changing data.

To reduce confusion, it is based on new release format starting from Revised Core Set and 2-box format expansions, along with all the repackaged expansions. It act as if the original Core Set doesn't exist, and there is no individual Mythos Pack.
