      "description_md": "For an expansion about ice it has a lot of cards about fire. This deck has them all working together : [Protective Gear](/card/08095), [Burn After Reading](/card/08076), and [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080).\r\n\r\nThis is a 2nd take of Daniela 2 packs deck, from [**Tanking Cats and Dogs**](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35588) I made last year when I was a lot less experienced. That deck was about Ally and Accessory health / sanity stacking, which can take a lot of time to setup. This deck has minimal of both Ally and Accessory, and focus on [Bruiser](/card/08122)'s Melee and Armor discount / boost instead.\r\n\r\nA lot of XP goes to utility Event cards. I restored [Lucky!](/card/01084) back to Daniela via its Lv. 2 version and more heals + utils via [Call for Backup](/card/08129). They are strategically Lv. 2, so work as a possible exile target of [Burn After Reading](/card/08076) to burn brightly.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ❄ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP. They can then get into deck-building later if they wished to do so.

The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQyNTE4EAEKCQoFMzU1ODgQAQoJCgU0MjUwNhABCgkKBTM1NjkzEAEKCQoFMzU4MzgQAQoJCgUzNTQ2MBABCgkKBTM1NTExEAEKCQoFMzcxMzMQAQoJCgUzNzEzMhABCgkKBTM2MTI3EAEKCQoFMzcxMzEQAQoJCgUzNjE1MxAB)\r\n\r\n# Splash\r\n\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bandages**</span>](/card/08073) : Solid tanking card that does not use any slot, can stack over Ally and Armor.\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Talisman of Protection**</span>](/card/08116) : Very important card to not die by horror first with health remaining, in addition to [Medical Student](/card/08083). Also important in adding <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> class for [Call for Backup](/card/08129) to heal even more horror. More horror heals equal more counter attacks since Daniela is likely bottlenecked on horror.\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Rabbit's Foot**</span>](/card/01575) : Since this deck does not yet use Accessory, here's a single copy of lucky charm that may let you recover from bad mulligan.\r\n\r\n# How the upgrade plan works\r\n\r\nWe stuck with 1x [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002), 2x [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) and 2x [Knife](/card/01086) for long time until 24 XP, but [Bruiser](/card/08122) will make them better. (Don't forget to use discount on play, it is not just the boost.) Besides, Daniela has 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to easily get to 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with any weapon for comfortable hit vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. It is better to spend XP improving other things like surviving / counter attacking, instead of straight up fighting.\r\n\r\nEven [Guard Dog](/card/01021) are removed! I prefer [Medical Student](/card/08083) as Ally of choice here for synergy with [Call for Backup](/card/08129) added later, and I run out of deck space in the plan to not remove [Guard Dog](/card/01021).\r\n\r\nAfter 2x [Bruiser](/card/08122), you have a chance to get all <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> class on the field (or most of them), therefore [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) is added to capitalize this. Sometimes Daniela can win even evasion or investigation test. (Or scenario test of <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, which is not uncommon.)\r\n\r\n[Protective Gear](/card/08095) is a rare card in our pool that can take horror, so it will be very useful to fully make use of her counter attack when enemies often deal balanced 1/1. Plus can make use of [Bruiser](/card/08122) Armor discount to put down easier.\r\n\r\nSince Daniela has limited five Lv.0 <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>, we add in [Lucky!](/card/01084) via its Lv. 2 upgrade instead. This take place of [Guts](/card/01089) that were there to pass horror treachery at 6 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. Since she already has 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, now you just hold [Lucky!](/card/01084) on hand when testing 3-4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> instead of having to commit.\r\n\r\n[Call for Backup](/card/08129) is a reasonably costed heal card (you heal 1/1 with [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) equipped), which let Daniela tank for more hits. With [Medical Student](/card/08083) on board she can even cheat a clue.\r\n\r\nAt 19 XP point we have quite a concentration of Lv.2 card, so it is time to add 1x [Burn After Reading](/card/08076) so you have some chance to use the doom removal effect as well. (2 auto clues is also good for taking VP location.) If this wins more XP for the party, don't be afraid to sacrifice just your own XP!\r\n\r\nAfter 19 XP it is just adding consistency via [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080), which is an unlimited [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) with evasion feature that Daniela can't normally perform. We still keep both [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) for mulligan consistency. (You always have 5 weapon cards including your signature, you should see one of them on mulligan.)\r\n\r\n# Clue finding for dumb investigator\r\n\r\nThis deck unexpectedly has a lot of cards at the end of upgrade that can get you clues even if you have 1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>!\r\n\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Evidence!**</span>](/card/01522) : Kill stuff.\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Strength in Numbers**</span>](/card/08077) • : With 3 or more classes on board you can get to respectable 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to pick up an odd clue.\r\n- 2x [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Call for Backup**</span>](/card/08129) •• : With [Medical Student](/card/08083) on board she will go get you a clue for cheap cost of 1.\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Burn After Reading**</span>](/card/08076) • : 2 clues for 1 XP of your own.\r\n\r\nIt worth having some clues on you even if your Seeker can do all the work, sometimes you need to drop or spend it to cancel some kind of effect, like [Hunting Shadow](/card/01135).\r\n\r\n# Notable counterattacking cards\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dodge**</span>](/card/01523) : Her ability said she counters even when attack is cancelled, so this card is cool.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Talisman of Protection**</span>](/card/08116)  : Even with all damage / horror cancelled the enemy still just attacked you, so you can counter attack anyway. Cool!\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Toe to Toe**</span>](/card/08020) : Your **ultimate** attack Event is right here in the starting deck. You can instantly pop 3 damages (including your counter attack) **with no test involved and 0 resource**. 3 HP enemy dying in 1 action is very satisfying and will sprint you ahead of doom clock.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bandages**</span>](/card/08073) : Note that you can't heal back [Medical Student](/card/08083) before she dies.",

Is this a joke deck? With full collection, probably. With 2 packs? It is quite respectable I should say! Even so, I admit this deck is kinda meme and theme more than anything else.\r\n\r\nThis deck is extremely heavy in Asset, and cannot investigate at all. (Do not try using it true solo!)

Daniela!\r\n\r\nWhile this simplistic thinking without any obvious synergy may not result in incredibly powerful deck, it make the best use possible for what (2 packs) you have without leaving these dogs sad in your collection.\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : Edge of the Earth series is now complete** with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Daniela Reyes: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Burning Bruiser](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42518)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Daniela Reyes: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Tanking Cats and Dogs](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35588)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Norman Withers: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Double Icons in the Stars](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42506)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Norman Withers: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Norman the Miskatonic Tutor](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35693)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Monterey Jack: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : The Underworld Bullwhip](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35838)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Lily Chen: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Lily the WILL AGI Battle-Mage](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35460)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Bob Jenkins: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Short Supply Scavenging](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35511)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Roland the Real, Authentic Spy](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37133)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Guns and Books](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37132)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Destiny Draw](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36127)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Agnes the \"Mahou Shoujo\"](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37131)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Wendy Lovecrafting](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36153)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all.

With all these lovely pets she has now, they will be \"you\" instead of you. (Don't tell PETA about this deck.)\r\n\r\n# The \"3 accessories combo\"\r\n\r\n1. [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Rod of Animalism**</span>](/card/08128) •\r\n2. <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bangle of Jinxes**</span>](/card/08075) •\r\n3. <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Precious Memento**</span>](/card/08114) ••••\r\n\r\nThis deck is the most notably that it needs 2x [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) to function. This is in order to equip [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128) + [Bangle of Jinxes](/card/08075) + [Precious Memento](/card/08114) at the same time. A heavy commitment of 14 XP total if you purchase maximum copies of each! We will go for this first before purchasing other cards.\r\n\r\nGeneral idea of the combo is so that when you make your pets tank for counter attacks, you would assign some **horrors** to the [Precious Memento](/card/08114) and at the same time jinx [Bangle of Jinxes](/card/08075).\r\n\r\n[Precious Memento](/card/08114)'s horror can be slowly healed out 1 per turn by over-succeeding. To do this, you would use some charges out of your [Bangle of Jinxes](/card/08075) and using [Bruiser](/card/08122).\r\n\r\nThe stone can also take damages, but to heal out you need an epic fail. It is better to put some damages on Daniela with her 8 health. Anyway, it is a good idea to let the stone having more than 0 damage just in case you get an epic fail.\r\n\r\nTogether with [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128)'s ability to put on a lot of animals in play, you will have enough time taking care of the stone to last long as well.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\nYou will have to make some \"stops\" along the way because the complete combo set (the \"3 accessories combo\") is very expensive. You should make yourself better incrementally. And at each step, your play style will change.\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|  | **Pet

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n## 1. Pet adoption\r\n\r\nThis step is about getting the dog rods and the chew toy ([Precious Memento](/card/08114)). Everything here costs total 9 XP which is unlikely to get in one stage.\r\n\r\nEven if all the dogs at 2 resources with [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128), this deck is still very resource hungry! (I often have to devote 1 action to collect resource, so combined with 1 resource I get in upkeep, I can stack 1 more sled dog.) Therefore only 1 [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is replaced here and keep an another in.\r\n\r\nLater on, we will add [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) to replace the other [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and partially address expensive dogs problem.\r\n\r\n## 2. Memento tanking system\r\n\r\nThis step is about prolonging the [Precious Memento](/card/08114). It has 3 sets of varying total XP price (5,4,2) (each set has cards that are used together) for you to choose which one you want to go first. **But** after choosing the 1st set, take the loan set.\r\n\r\n[Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) is **important** for this deck, since there are tons of setup assets (allies) that can get going on their own once you put them down together. This is the only big money Daniela can use given just 2 packs you have now, thanks to it being Survivor multi-class.\r\n\r\nAn example being [Sled Dog](/card/08127) where just 1 is nothing more than a nice soak, or a single [Guard Dog](/card/01021) and a supporting [Bandages](/card/08073) that can last you many turns of peace but requires upfront payments up to 5 without the rod, or you want to put the rod down with some dogs instead of having to wait for the next turn.\r\n\r\nConversely, when you wait for resource drip and play things one by one, you will find the things you played melt away before you could get your system going.\r\n\r\nThis deck only has lightweight Event cards. Many costs 0 and some up to 1. You will be able to pay back the loan once your setup is completed and you continue fighting and managing health with assets you put down.\r\n\r\nThe loan is AWESOME. \r\n\r\n## 3. Toys\r\n\r\nAt this point you have used 23 XP total, and likely you are at mid to late point in the story. Consider things past this point to incrementally make yourself better rather than being a critical piece of the combo.\r\n\r\nCongratulations on completing your pet family! You better not remove that remaining 1x [Stray Cat](/card/01076) though, for style point.\r\n\r\n# Thinking about tanking\r\n\r\nCounter attack damage is always 1. Meaning that you are at more disadvantage the more damages or horrors that enemy could deal.\r\n\r\nElite enemy with 2 damages + 2 horrors for example, you want to attack it normally as much as possible. You may need some other investigator to help evade it until all other enemies dies as they attack you for lower damage.\r\n\r\nInversely, Daniela is good with high enemy count where they each deal 1 damage and 1 horror. (Or even just 1 damage or just 1 horror) The ability procs every time without exhausting. Let them swarm her and soon they would all disappear! \r\n\r\nWhen you are engaged with a lot of enemies, you are not able to cycle your Ally because doing so would provoke AoO that you cannot counter. This is a big problem on early scenario as you do not have [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128) yet to tank long enough for enemy hoards to disappear. Try contributing damage with normal attack as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant mini-game of whether to save action or save your health/horror with Daniela. The way to \"speed up\" your tempo is by intentionally leaving engaged enemy with 1 HP for the counter to last shot it, because counter always deal 1 damage and technically using enemy's \"action\" instead of you. Try practice feeling whether you are \"behind\" or \"ahead\" of the scenario timer, then adjust your damage taking. The best case scenario is that you always ended the scenario with blood soaking all over at 7 damages, 5 horrors, and [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) gone. That means you have already exhausted your tempo advantage to the maximum.\r\n\r\nIf not nearing the end yet, don't let the damage rack up to 7 if possible, because it will be impossible to [Bandages](/card/08073) yourself at that point. You must take a damage first to use this item. Using [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) will not make it better either once you are at 7 damages since it cancels, not heal. The only way out if you must take up to 7 damages is to heal, which this deck provides several ways to do so.\r\n\r\n# How to use [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002)\r\n\r\n- Remember that <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> means it does not cost action. Therefore, this occasionally means you can deal 1 damage per turn without any action by Daniela's counter attack (it is not an AoO provoke, it is a \"real\" provoke), but costing your health/horror instead. This is an aggressive attempt to gain tempo since you decided it is not worth it to wait until Enemy Phase for it to attack. I feel it is difficult to weight when this ability is truly worthwhile.  \r\n- Exhausting from <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> does not make the 2nd Fight ability disappear, as it does not say exhaust is the cost of that action.\r\n- On <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> Fight, pay attention to target requirement. It says \"since the end of your last turn\". \"Turn\" is after you used up your 3rd action and pass on to the other player.\r\n  - For example, if you use <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> provoke inside your turn for it to attack, or some special token or treacheries cause it to attack inside your turn, that attack won't count towards your \"vengeance\" criteria for wrench Fight on the next turn since it resets as soon as you say end your turn.\r\n  - Enemy that had just spawned fresh on you from encounter draw, you cannot whack it with the wrench just yet, but using <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> first will allows you to do so right away at a cost of your health/horror.\r\n  - Usually the best tactics to deal with enemy spawned onto a typical Guardian is to completely kill it before its first Enemy Phase comes, because you are already engaged and ready to pump 3 actions into it. Wrench's target weakness maybe more annoying than you thought.\r\n- If you used [Dodge](/card/01023), the canceled attack never happened. (Just that it initiated. Wrench says \"has attacked you\", with Dodge, it hadn't attacked.) So you cannot hit it with the wrench. (However Dodge works with Daniela's ability, since it says \"even if that attack was canceled\" explicitly.) See the [Cancel rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Cancel) for more info.\r\n\r\n# Early scenario ally slot guide\r\n\r\nThis deck is very tricky on first few scenarios since your 8 (!!) Ally that we have to include upfront for later upgrades will be competing for 1 Ally slot. And they are expensive to play as well.\r\n\r\nWhen you have [Guard Dog](/card/01021) down and you draw 1 [Sled Dog](/card/08127), it is tempting to not replace [Guard Dog](/card/01021) when you have not use it up fully. But [Sled Dog](/card/08127) can stack on to the same slot, it is important that you play one before the other comes. Otherwise, you need to pay a hefty 3 + 3 = 6 resources at once or you won't even get a chance to play any in a big fight.\r\n\r\nTherefore in early scenarios you should be aggressive with using [Guard Dog](/card/01021), even to dispose small critters. If you get [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002), use <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> liberally to make it attack [Guard Dog](/card/01021) for an instant 2 damages at 0 action.\r\n\r\nPlaying [Medical Student](/card/08083) will bump out all cats and dogs in early scenarios when you don't have [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128). But with horror unable to be assigned to [Guard Dog](/card/01021) that easily and Daniela having 6 sanity, and you don't have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) for horror soak, I think having horror healing is very useful in a pinch.\r\n\r\n# Losing [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128)\r\n\r\nThe [Slots rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Slots) where it says the slot check only occurs when playing or gaining control of ally :\r\n\r\n> If playing or gaining control of an asset would put an investigator above his or her slot limit for that type of asset, the investigator must choose and discard other assets under his or her control simultaneously with the new asset entering the slot.\r\n\r\nReading strictly this definition, it is possible to play all the Ally you want while having the rod, then equip [Bangle of Jinxes](/card/08075) to bump out the rod (or losing the rod due to e.g. Crypt Chill), and now you get to keep all the allies since you are not playing or gaining any ally just yet after you lose the rod.\r\n\r\nBut I also see someone in the community said that  if you lose the rod, then you must immediately kill all allies to your new limit.\r\n\r\nI am not sure which one is true, so for now, I use the Grim Rule and follow the worse one that your ally dies down to 1 slot instantly when you lose the rod.\r\n\r\n# The 5 splashes\r\n\r\nDaniela starts out mostly <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> with only 5 <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>, then gradually gaining higher level reds later.\r\n\r\nSurvivor is a strong class because of many useful level 0 cards available. Very unfortunately, this Daniela absolutely need 2x [Stray Cat](/card/01076) for theme and 2x [Bandages](/card/08073) to take care of her other pets. That left only 1 slot hotly contested.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) makes the cut, and that is reflected in the deck you see here. But it is up to you which Survivor card you like. Here are some interesting options :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">\"Hit me!\"</span>](/card/08112) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01580) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\"Look what I found!\"</span>](/card/01579) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Leather Coat</span>](/card/01572) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Rabbit's Foot</span>](/card/01575) (You want even more animals?)\r\n\r\n1x [Stray Cat](/card/01076) is going to be replaced (see upgrade guide section). The deck includes 2x [Stray Cat](/card/01076) for thematic purpose, but actually you can include just 1 and replace the other cat with any in the list above.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Talisman of Protection**</span>](/card/08116) \r\n\r\nYou are tanker and this helps you not die. Though, be aware that if you let the damage rack up to 7 then you cannot use [Bandages](/card/08073) on yourself.\r\n\r\nIf possible, trigger the talisman by adding horror to Daniela when the [Precious Memento](/card/08114) cannot take it anymore.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Guard Dog**</span>](/card/01521) \r\n\r\nFor the dog to bite, you will assign it 1 damage and 1 horror somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThis horror is ideally landing on [Precious Memento](/card/08114), which when Daniela whack with her high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, can be healed off by 1 point per turn. Then you should trigger reaction ability on [Bandages](/card/08073) immediately to remove damage part from your dog. BFF!\r\n\r\n[\"Get behind me!\"](/card/08021) can be used to remove horror part from enemy's damage, so you have only damage to distribute.\r\n\r\nThis dog is a part of big fat combo together with [Toe to Toe](/card/08020). See that card's section for details.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Medical Student**</span>](/card/08083) \r\n\r\nPlaying [Medical Student](/card/08083) will bump out all cats and dogs in early scenarios when you don't have [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128). But with horror unable to be assigned to [Guard Dog](/card/01021) that easily and Daniela having 6 sanity, and you don't have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) for horror soak yet, I think having horror healing is very useful in a pinch.\r\n\r\nAll replaced as soon as you start to have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) and [Earthly Serenity](/card/08117) purchased.\r\n\r\nCan also be used to heal EotE weakness for other investigators.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Sled Dog**</span>](/card/08127) \r\n\r\nBy going to review page of this card, you will be discouraged with a lot of negative criticism. But none of them talks about Daniela. We can make the dogs worthwhile with her.\r\n\r\nNormal weapons gives up to +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy with +1 damage. This is the same as 2 [Sled Dog](/card/08127) (2 damages is the same thing as +1 damage.) So you \"break even\" with the other weapons at this point.\r\n\r\nDo not try too hard to get 3 or 4 dogs, as Daniela should utilize soaks regularly.\r\n\r\nRemember that you also have movement option with the dogs.\r\n\r\nIn early scenarios where you do not have [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128) yet, and you have a stack of 2 dogs down, try distribute the damage equally instead of letting it die one by one. If you are pressed to play [Guard Dog](/card/01021) or [Medical Student](/card/08083), you will lose both dogs (due to 1 ally slot). Try fully use their health and sanity for Daniela's counter before then.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Stray Cat**</span>](/card/01576) \r\n\r\nIts <span class=\"icon-free\"></span> ability is different from letting the cat die and use Daniela's ability for it to be auto-evade because you avoid taking damage instead of taking first then evade. However, Daniela's ability works with Elite enemy as well. Therefore, [Stray Cat](/card/01076) is great for handling non-Elite enemy that somehow hits for 2 damages or 2 horrors and you don't want to trade that for 1 damage counter attack.\r\n\r\nThe cat has an another quirk which is its 1 play cost. When you have [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128) down it became free, which is handy when resource is tight. Play them and let them die fast because the dogs maybe coming soon to take the space.\r\n\r\nYou cannot use [Bandages](/card/08073)' <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> in time to save the cat with its 1 health.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bandages**</span>](/card/08073) \r\n\r\nVery flexible and agile healing card that can also be used on Ally. The quirk being that it cannot heal horror, and you have to heal at that moment you are taking damage.\r\n\r\nIt cannot save [Stray Cat](/card/01076), and also cannot save you when you have 7/8 damage.\r\n\r\nWhen playing EotE campaign, try not letting your Partner with low health at critical point so you can continue to bandage them if required. This deck got 2 bandages, if you let the health gets to critical then it may means those 2 bandages become useless dead cards in the hand not worth putting down.\r\n\r\nThis can be used to heal Weakness that says it is treated as 1 point of damage, by taking damage, trigger bandage, but instead of healing the damage you just took, heal the weakness instead and left the damage there. (Your friend may come to your location and beg for damage to happen so you can bandage their weakness away!)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"Get behind me!\"**</span>](/card/08021) \r\n\r\nDaniela wants engagement, but treachery draw rule states that it engages with whoever draws it.\r\n\r\nBy bunching up at the same location as your non-fighter, if that investigator draws an enemy, with this card on your hand, that investigator can easily \"forward\" the enemy to you. Making the investigation continues smoothly. (It is as if you have [Scrying](/card/01061) and had arranged so you as the fighter takes an enemy instead of your clue gatherer.)\r\n\r\nJust let that investigator go first in turn, do anything they want (move, investigate, play, etc.) and when enemy is going to AoO as a cost before doing those action, you play this card and take both the attack and engagement. Also notice that Daniela's ability says \"except an AoO that **YOU** provoked.\". In this case, the other provokes the AoO and not you. You will get to counter when using Get Behind Me.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dodge**</span>](/card/01523) \r\n\r\nWhen enemy hits hard, you are at disadvantage regarding to counter attack. Among the swarm of engaged enemies, you should only take damages from lighter enemies and selectively skip the hard hitting one with this card. Hopefully things cleared up by then.\r\n\r\nYou still can use Daniela's counter too since it says \"even if that attack was cancelled\".\r\n\r\nYou can play this to [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) on 2 damages 2 horrors Elite enemy without taking those heavy damages.\r\n\r\nIf you cancels an attack with Dodge, it does not count that the enemy attacked you. Therefore it may invalidate <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> criteria on [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Toe to Toe**</span>](/card/08020) \r\n\r\nNeedless to say the cost that enemy attack you is what you want with Daniela. That should go to the pets or asset, then she will be angry and deals 1 damage from innate ability. Then your test-less attack deals 2 damages. Never remove this card!\r\n\r\nIf the attack you goes to [Guard Dog](/card/01021), you can make the total damage from playing this card up to 4 without touching the chaos bag at all and play cost is also 0. Never replace this card when upgrading. Annoying 4 HP enemies begone!\r\n\r\nIt is easy to forgot to have enough health to use Toe to Toe to Elite enemy. Last-shotting a boss without chaos bag pull worths a lot but you must be healthy enough to survive its heavy attack. Save up [Dodge](/card/01023) in pair with [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) makes it a potent sure-fire weapon.\r\n\r\nThis has small synergy with [Precious Memento](/card/08114) too. According to [auto success rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Automatic_Failure_Success), it does not mean you skip an entire test and throw damage tokens to the enemy. The test still occurs as normal and it is just that you skip chaos bag pull (ST.3, ST.4) and the difficulty became 0 (ST.6). This is useful to trigger \"succeed by\" on [Precious Memento](/card/08114) as with Daniela you have succeed by at least 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> vs. 0 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> in an auto-success.\r\n\r\nTherefore if you are doing the dog + stone combo, the spilled horror from the dog is likely gone as well as the damage that could be healed with [Bandages](/card/08073).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/01525) \r\n\r\nYou can contribute them when using [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) to get even bigger damage. [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) is still a Fight, and Fight is a test of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> icon. You can surely commit any cards with <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n[Toe to Toe](/card/08020) Fight is automatically successful, and according to [auto success rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Automatic_Failure_Success), you skip only chaos bag pull but you still getting through commit step before that. Making this +1 damage reliable to adjust enemy health (especially bosses) to an exact number you wish.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bangle of Jinxes**</span>](/card/08075) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThis card looks like it was released for Daniela. Remember to use <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> even when assigning all damages and horrors to your ally or assets, due to the \"you\" rule.\r\n\r\nThe [rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Uses) says that the 1 charge meant it starts with 1 charge. It does not mean it also has a maximum of 1 charge. You can continue storing charges as you got hit.\r\n\r\nIf you have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) down, the bangle's spare charge should also be regularly used to ensure 2 over-succeed and heal the stone if you haven't this turn. This combo requires [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) purchase, which actually the Accessory slot will still be contested with [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Bruiser**</span>](/card/08122) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThis card is for over-succeeding [Precious Memento](/card/08114) while fighting normally with <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, making the stone lasts much longer.\r\n\r\nIt is also able to discount playing Melee and Armor cards. Not as many as Ally, but still helpful : \r\n\r\n- [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002)\r\n- [Ice Pick](/card/08105)\r\n- [Protective Gear](/card/08095)\r\n- [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Earthly Serenity**</span>](/card/08119) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nDaniela can heal herself in order to continue tanking and using her innate ability, with her surprising amount of <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> stats.\r\n\r\nIt is also very handy to heal other investigators, including their EotE weaknesses that are treated as 1 point of damage or horror. The \"spray\" property of this card really helps because you may only want to meet up for only a brief moment and then get going.\r\n\r\nIf you have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) down, the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test can double as a chance to heal horror out from the stone since the difficulty is low, then you can continue tanking more and counter more. Since stone can only remove 1 per turn, you may choose not to spend too many charges even when getting high succeed-by to spread out the healing to multiple turns.\r\n\r\nNote that [Earthly Serenity](/card/08117) won't go anywhere when out of charges, you can still use the <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> and do nothing in an attempt to heal horror from the stone. (There is a risk of losing resource though, and special symbols may hurt the scenario more.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Ice Pick**</span>](/card/08105) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThis is provided as a flexible option. Sometimes, when you have [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002) on one hand and [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080) on the other, it feels like one is a backup rather than synergizing with each other.\r\n\r\nIf you can perfectly fulfill [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002)'s Fight criteria, then having [Ice Pick](/card/08105) on the other hand is better. The same as when you only managed to pick up [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080) but not [Mechanic's Wrench](/card/08002).\r\n\r\nHowever, if you picked up just the [Ice Pick](/card/08105) without the other weapon, you cannot deal +1 damage.\r\n\r\nYou can also exhaust it to improve [Sled Dog](/card/08127)'s attack accuracy. When you are performing 3-4 dogs attack for big damage, you may want to ensure success by having it over the difficulty by 3 or 4 points.\r\n\r\nUse it together with [Bruiser](/card/08122) for boosting to that succeed by 2 required for [Precious Memento](/card/08114).\r\n\r\nInvestigate option can sometimes help in 1 shroud location.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Precious Memento**</span>](/card/08114) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\n[Guard Dog](/card/01021) and [Aquinnah](/card/01082) takes only damage to use the ability, the spilled horror should be assigned to this stone. They can then be healed off by over-succeeding later.\r\n\r\n[Earthly Serenity](/card/08117) is great to get succeed by 2 or more to remove horror from the stone, especially the upgraded version that the difficulty is 0 and Daniela has 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>!\r\n\r\nUse [Bruiser](/card/08122) and [Bangle of Jinxes](/card/08075) for support in taking care of the stone.\r\n\r\nDaniela is expected to face tank <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery test. Make sure to not forget the fail by 2 or more <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and heal the health. (Rarely, you maybe forced to test <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, but often the forced one is <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Protective Gear**</span>](/card/08095) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThis deck has no Body slot at all until you purchase this card. But because all the Ally and [Precious Memento](/card/08114) will help you tank, this can be very late purchase.\r\n\r\nIt will help with <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treacheries also because those could be Hazard. But man, this gear is EXPENSIVE to play!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Rod of Animalism**</span>](/card/08128) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThe cost of each [Sled Dog](/card/08127) is a hefty 3 without [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128).\r\n\r\n[Stray Cat](/card/01076) is free to play with rod down. The cat benefits a lot from exclusive Creature slot since it should wait in ready for activation while you do other things with your \"main\" pets.\r\n\r\nThe deck includes 2x rod for consistency, but notice the <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> star in front of the name. It means the item is unique and there is supposed to be one such thing in the world/story. (Perhaps this is a personal rod of a famous animal tamer.) If one rod is down you cannot play an another one even if you have [Relic Hunter](/card/01695). You can throw it away for commit.\r\n\r\n# Inter-investigator combos\r\n\r\n- [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102) : Have someone (probably Seekers) purchase this and fight along side her at the same location (they should be when the party has Daniela). Whenever her pet is dead, capture them into the jar. It also states that it is possible to use reaction ability in response to discarded by card effect, so Daniela can release her [Stray Cat](/card/01076) straight to the pot and get both test-less evade and draw 3 cards. Massive tempo gain!\r\n- [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) : Release [Stray Cat](/card/01076) to auto-evade difficult enemy using Player Window before the action of investigator with Sneak Attack. You can also release the cat in your turn to whack Retaliate enemy safely. Daniela's ability can auto-evade too but it must not be the one you provoked, so that is likely in Enemy Phase, which make it impossible to [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) before the enemy is ready again in Upkeep Phase up next.\r\n- [Bob Jenkins](/card/08016) : You can give some [Bandages](/card/08073) to Bob instead if he is in play, so he can [Scavenging](/card/01073) and infinitely give them to you. (When you exhaust all supplies, it is auto discarded back to Bob.) Immortal pets army!\r\n- Anyone with the new EotE weaknesses : Gather around Daniela to get healed with her strong-willed [Earthly Serenity](/card/08119). (Also Daniela should help kill all the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> sticky treacheries on others.)",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nThe first 6 XP are like that because we have 2x [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) and 2x [Research Librarian](/card/01032) to search up 1 copy of those cards added to the deck. This way we can get other non-searchable cards into the deck faster. So mulligan with this in mind in the 2nd scenario so you get to use your new XP card to farm more XP.\r\n\r\n2x [Grounded (3)](/card/08069) is where it gets more comfortable, able to [Blur](/card/08109) at 6+ <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, [Shrivelling](/card/01060) at 5+ <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, and the Composure can take some beating against unlucky <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery.\r\n\r\nWith [Scrying (3)](/card/01690) added right after, you will be much less likely to randomly slip down any ice cliff again by arranging it to other players, or even skip it with [Foresight](/card/08064).\r\n\r\nWhen 2nd [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) added at the very end of 29 XP section, [Research Librarian](/card/01032) are **all phased out**, which may make you feel uneasy not able to search [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005) like before.\r\n\r\nBut instead of drawing [Research Librarian](/card/01032) and having to pay 2 and an action to search then play the thing you searched, you will surely see other interesting cards to play for immediate benefit instead at this XP point. Even a humble [Perception](/card/01090), that draws you a new card while you work and let you go towards [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005) anyway. Besides Norman is fine without his signature. [Research Librarian](/card/01032) also has an irrelevant <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icon. I think it is best to remove all to make your endgame deck really concentrated with good icons.\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : Edge of the Earth series is now complete** with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Daniela Reyes: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Burning Bruiser](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42518)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Daniela Reyes: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Tanking Cats and Dogs](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35588)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Norman Withers: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Double Icons in the Stars](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42506)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Norman Withers: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Norman the Miskatonic Tutor](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35693)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Monterey Jack: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : The Underworld Bullwhip](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35838)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Lily Chen: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Lily the WILL AGI Battle-Mage](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35460)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Bob Jenkins: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Short Supply Scavenging](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/35511)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Roland the Real, Authentic Spy](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37133)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Guns and Books](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37132)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Destiny Draw](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36127)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Agnes the \"Mahou Shoujo\"](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37131)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [❄ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Wendy Lovecrafting](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36153)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all.

When purchasing in new Lv.1+ <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>, we will be careful not to remove these cards.\r\n\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Initiate**</span>](/card/01563) : Get to your spells faster. Prioritize \r\n[Blur (1)](/card/08109) and [Shrivelling](/card/01060) which let you survive, then [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) which let you accelerate clues as your final action to end each turn. For [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), it has nice <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icon and you maybe able to get up to hand with [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) committing later.\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Shrivelling**</span>](/card/01560) : This will forever be your only offensive spell in the deck. The reason of not using [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) is because [Shrivelling](/card/01060) has better synergy with [Winds of Power](/card/08063), which is a card with nice <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> icons. We will \"upgrade\" this spell via [Grounded](/card/08069).\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Holy Rosary**</span>](/card/01559) : I would like 2 copies of this if it is possible! But the other 4 cards are more important. [Grounded (3)](/card/08069) will take the boosting role of [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) in this deck, but together even better!\r\n\r\n# The icons\r\n\r\nThis deck is full of juicy icons that [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005), [Written in the Stars](/card/08034), and [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) can use. [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) also act as a tutor card, double icons are more likely to get a pass in the test.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Grounded**</span>](/card/08069) ••• : <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Scrying**</span>](/card/01690) ••• : <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Foresight**</span>](/card/08064) • : <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Winds of Power**</span>](/card/08063) • : <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Astronomical Atlas**</span>](/card/08067) ••• : <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Working a Hunch**</span>](/card/01537) : <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> (All removed later)\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) : <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Guts**</span>](/card/01589) : <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> (All removed later)\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Unexpected Courage**</span>](/card/01593) : <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>\r\n\r\n# How to support your team\r\n\r\nTeamplay is centered around <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Scrying**</span>](/card/01690) •••, an often overlooked card in Revised Core Set.\r\n\r\n- Use it on Encounter Deck and be surprised how much you can prepare, or even \"game\" against what you are getting, even without using [Foresight](/card/08064) combo to kill it. (But [Foresight](/card/08064) is a good idea to bypass enemy draw.) You will noticeably not draw the <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> test that deal damage to you anymore, unlike earlier scenarios. This is important as he has 1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> and the fail-by kind would destroy him. An enemy he can [Blur](/card/08109) away but <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> test he hates it!\r\n- Use it on other investigator's deck to tutor up to 3 cards deep, but that is not exciting, the real power is you can arrange clunky asset for [Foresight](/card/08064) (you name the correct card for sure when they draw in Upkeep or manually in their turn), gaining massive tempo for that investigator. (No action cost to play and even -2 resources!)\r\n- The top of deck you are seeing may not be to your liking. Use it on your own deck to see 2 more cards under it, and try getting a good cards for [Written in the Stars](/card/08034), [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) at the right moment, such as [Deduction](/card/01039) when you are standing on VP location.\r\n\r\nThere is [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066) with similar power and it looks deeper, but [Scrying (3)](/card/01690) is searchable with [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) and <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icon is better to win games when play with commit techs, plus charges can be refilled with [Winds of Power](/card/08063), which also has nice icons.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Heavy Furs**</span>](/card/08126) : These are replaced with [Grounded (3)](/card/08069), following [Grounded (3)](/card/08069) purchases are cards which help avoiding <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treacheries. The role of [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) is to take those <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery damage head-on while you wait for better countermeasure. So recommended **not** to use the symbol redraw effect if possible and keep 2 health for tanking. No other Ally in this deck can take 2 damage.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Rite of Seeking**</span>](/card/01689) •• : Mystics with low <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> like [Agnes Baker](/card/01004) maybe challenged to use it in 1st or 2nd action at risk of ending the turn early to get more than 2 clues, rather than using it only as a final action. But Norman has 5 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to investigate normally on 1st and 2nd action. Even if he use this safely as the final action only, he gets average of 4 clues in a round. (Plus he can evade \"for free\" with [Blur](/card/08109).)\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Grounded**</span>](/card/08069) ••• : It is not just the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to play with [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) or [Written in the Stars](/card/08034). This card is unexpectedly tanky giving Norman 2 precious health. I'm sure 6 XP for 2 copies of this will be used. (That said, you should have Ally take damage/horror instead of breaking Composure.) It upgrades [Shrivelling](/card/01060) which had no boost, and makes [Blur](/card/08109) even more reliable against 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. You can spend 1 resource to hit [Shrivelling](/card/01060) to 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemies.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Winds of Power**</span>](/card/08063) • : Since you see the top of your deck, you can always draw it to trigger <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. All spells are good target, even [Shrivelling](/card/01060). If you don't need the charge, the icon is good with [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005) / [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067).\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Foresight**</span>](/card/08064) • : Other than the support play with [Scrying (3)](/card/01690) to help friends setup, you can use it on yourself since you already see the top card of your deck. Since Norman has -1 discount play from top deck once per round, this allow doing that once again in the same turn (this time at -2 discount) if you want to setup many cards.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Medical Student**</span>](/card/08083) : 1 copy, which is handy to heal the new Edge of the Earth Basic Weakness.",

The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQyNTE4EAEKCQoFMzU1ODgQAQoJCgU0MjUwNhABCgkKBTM1NjkzEAEKCQoFMzU4MzgQAQoJCgUzNTQ2MBABCgkKBTM1NTExEAEKCQoFMzcxMzMQAQoJCgUzNzEzMhABCgkKBTM2MTI3EAEKCQoFMzcxMzEQAQoJCgUzNjE1MxAB)\r\n\r\n# Example benefits of [Forced Learning](/card/08031)\r\n\r\nWith this card your play start even earlier than Investigation Phase, you will be deciding in every Upkeep Phase based on 2 cards you see what you like to do in the upcoming Investigation Phase.\r\n\r\n- Throw away [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) in scenario that you can't make use of the remote investigation.\r\n- Throw away [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) when you can already [Blur](/card/08109).\r\n- With [Charisma](/card/01694) and 1 Ally down, you can look for synergistic allies and throw away what is not. For example, if you got 1 [Sled Dog](/card/08127) down early it is natural to look for more. But if you got [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) down early, it is natural to throw away all the dogs you found going forward since it would be too late to start collecting 2+ dogs later.\r\n- There are a lot of neutral skill cards here. Different campaign and scenario may not weight equally in required tests. Norman can pick what's matching the situation on [Forced Learning](/card/08031) to play with his commit techs.\r\n- Healing ([Earthly Serenity](/card/08117), [Medical Student](/card/08083)) is widely regarded as not a good play in Arkham Horror, you are not moving towards the goal and the existence of healing card replaces some other cards that let you just sprint to victory. It is too situational. But sometimes you can't really continue without healing. With [Forced Learning](/card/08031) you can almost always throw away all the healings, until it is really, really needed.\r\n- Throw away [Research Librarian](/card/01032) if you already found your tomes naturally. (The <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> is also not so relevant for Norman.)\r\n- Throw away [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) when you don't need the resource, this card has no commit icon and would be a truly dead draw without [Forced Learning](/card/08031).\r\n- There are several one-offs in the deck : [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031), [Barricade](/card/01038), [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032), [Professor William Webb](/card/08104). The best example would be [Barricade](/card/01038). Very rarely that [Barricade](/card/01038) is needed at the right moment, and if it comes up at wrong moment you feel like you wasted a draw. With [Forced Learning](/card/08031), you can now throw it away most of the time and not feel bad. (And feel like a boss if you do pick it up on special occassion.\r\n- Not a direct usage but the increased deck size holds 4x [Sled Dog](/card/08127). In other decks the dog will eat up a lot of deck space.\r\n- Throw away [Overpower](/card/01091) which is most of the time irrelevant for Norman, except when he gets 2x [Sled Dog](/card/08127) and want to deal 2 damage with <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. (You can also use [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) for [Sled Dog](/card/08127) hits.)\r\n\r\n# Example plays\r\n\r\n- [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) is the very core card of typical Norman deck, and yes this deck is typical. If you saw 2 commit icons on top of the deck or even a <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon, just take those cards face down. After committing they will be back on your hand anyway (of course, if the test succeeds), and even could recycle again if you have [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005) to put it back on top of the deck.\r\n- [Livre d'Eibon](/card/08005), we mainly use the first ability to manage top deck card to combo with :\r\n  - [Astronomical Atlas](/card/08067) to stock desired commit card.\r\n  - [Foresight](/card/08064) to get 2 resources discount and save action (Fast meant you do not use action) when you draw it.\r\n  - [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) after put strong commit card on top of deck. \r\n  - Play any card for -1 cost with his innate ability.\r\n- [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) + commit skill cards with special effects other than draw-one, like [Fearless](/card/01067) or [Deduction](/card/01039). \r\n  - With [Blur](/card/08109)'s extra actions, the star is aligned for him for extra long time to to trigger special effect multiple times.\r\n- [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) + [Sled Dog](/card/08127) attack. +<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> of multiple dogs aren't enough to hit stuff but + damages are significant, so with [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) we gain high accuracy and the dog's damages.\r\n- Even though we have [Charisma](/card/01694), you likely get only up to 2 [Sled Dog](/card/08127) stacking in a single slot, not the dream 4 [Sled Dog](/card/08127). I think that is enough as the real benefit is once per round, but unlimited, 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy 2 damage attack, to help saving [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) charges. (And the health soaks.)\r\n\r\n# [Kirby](/card/08032) guide\r\n\r\nThis Miskatonic dude came from Arctic all the way to Antarctic to aid you. When deciding even or odd, at least you see 1 card on top of the deck. But what about the other 4?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this deck has tons of Skill card which the cost is \"none\" and therefore not even and not odd. He is here because of [Forced Learning](/card/08031) and his +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> bonus, which combines with [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) into +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> when you have got enough [Charisma](/card/01694). (You cannot put down 2 [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033), due to unique <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> symbol.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is a handy chance guide regarding even and odd for this deck.

Other than this, you can say \"even\" when playing [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032). Lost whip for whatever reason has a chance of coming back via [Professor William Webb](/card/08106) in the upgrade.\r\n\r\nThe other star of this deck is [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) as opposed to more popular [Gené Beauregard](/card/08099).

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n## Ally set\r\n\r\nYou will be **delighted** when you purchase [Michael Leigh](/card/08086). Since this is an [Underworld Support](/card/08046) deck, even 1 purchase is enough to see him often. Making your 5 XP very worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThis is his source of +1 damage other than the single whip exhaust he has each turn. [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) do not exhaust when refilling evidence, but do exhaust to use +1 damage.\r\n\r\nYou can deal 3 damages in 1 action now by using the whip's +1 damage and Michael's evidence. You will soon realize how 3 HP enemy instantly dies is so useful to keep him moving. No more auto-evade when you can just kill it.\r\n\r\nWhen using +1 damage, you must exhaust [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) on attack's initiation, not after it succeed. If you misses, you still lose the evidence.\r\n\r\n[Charisma](/card/01694) is critical to improve flexibility should you get [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) before or after [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). Likely you want to keep [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) static, and try to have the other one [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) to pump resource and cards from Monterey's ability.\r\n\r\nThough if you do get [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) before [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), utilize +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> he has and use him to search for [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008). It is best if you get [Buried Secrets](/card/08009) while having him.\r\n\r\n## Equipments set\r\n\r\nWe keep [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) since our card collection don't have any other suitable weapon. (Not even the 2 XP version is usable with him.) With [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) passive <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> buff and [Ice Pick](/card/08105), he can sometimes dispose 2 HP low combat enemy faster with the gun without spending [Michael Leigh](/card/08086)'s evidence. [Overpower](/card/01091) helps getting +1 damage from the gun.\r\n\r\nHave to keep in mind Monterey has exhaust condition on +1 damage in everything, both whip and [Michael Leigh](/card/08086). Gun can be clutch to fix enemy swarm because it could fire multiple times.\r\n\r\nAlso even with [Underworld Support](/card/08046) sometimes the whip is buried down below, discarded from play by scenario effect, or a monster telling you to discard from top of deck rapidly and the whip is gone. It is just too risky in true solo for that to be your only lifeline. (Do try to use [Professor William Webb](/card/08106) you will add later to get back the whip if you can.)\r\n\r\n[Hiking Boots](/card/08035) is great when you start the turn with multiple unfinished clues. Trying to drain the clue and move to retain passive bonus may cause him to be too behind in term of gearing up. With the boots, you can immediately move for free then use your extra action to gear up. It also allows you to use your final action to pick up the final clue, then move to still activate Monterey's bonus. +1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> also improves [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008)'s accuracy without costing any equipment slot. Very good asset!\r\n\r\n[Pickpocketing](/card/01046) despite looking like it has synergy with whip auto-evade, Monterey already has good draw option by moving. I found it not so useful.\r\n\r\n## Research set\r\n\r\nSkip if you haven't completed your research yet. Choose any version you like but I would choose \"Acheron\" for multiplayer, and \"Aldebaran\" for solo.\r\n\r\n## Survival accessories set\r\n\r\nImprove horror survivability with [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095). After upgrading [Ice Pick](/card/08107), we immediately get [Professor William Webb (3)](/card/08106) which is able to revive [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), further reduce the chance of dying by horror.\r\n\r\nThis set closes out with [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041), which [Professor William Webb (3)](/card/08106) can also get back after triggering its 1-use abililty. Professor can also get back discarded [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) to accelerate clue works.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) is not needed here, as the disc is likely short lived. With some management it should cycle with [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) just fine.\r\n\r\nAt this point we have 4 Ally, luckily Monterey that walks a lot should be able to afford and replace them, preferably stabilizing at [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) + [Michael Leigh](/card/08086).\r\n\r\n[Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) is yet another rare +1 damage that Monterey additionally has, a pseudo [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) if you will. He is now able to one-shot 4 HP enemy together with [Michael Leigh](/card/08086)'s evidence and whip's exhaust +1 hit, at high accuracy when wearing [Hiking Boots](/card/08035).\r\n\r\nIt can be clutch in true solo to have [Professor William Webb](/card/08106) recurse [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) or [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) if you happened to draw a lot of enemies that you cannot continue the scenario. Also if your [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008) is gone because of supernatural reasons (there are a lot), this professor here can help restoring your whip.. you will want to take him to dinner after all these are over.\r\n\r\n## Extra relic set\r\n\r\nBefore this set you would have used 23 XP, which is an average end game XP. You may not able to afford this set.\r\n\r\nIf you can't managed to finish the [Archive of Conduits](/card/08033) research and haven't spent that 4 XP upgrade yet, and you are nearing the end, it is time to give up the research and replace it with [Eon Chart](/card/08098). Otherwise if you finished the research, remove [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) instead.\r\n\r\n# Monterey's puzzle\r\n\r\nHis ability will give you a constant puzzle each turn : \"How could I move every turn?\" Because you will receive the reward once you say you end your turn if you do so.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle looks simple, until you draw some enemies and you tangle yourself several turns later.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes you are desperate to move and can move, but there is nothing to do at the destination. Maybe you can fix this by not draining all the clues in one go?\r\n- Sometimes you made mistake how many locations away from mixture of exhausted, engaged, or ready enemies all over the map, should you stop each turn. Simulating Hunter enemy's movement carefully and you will be rewarded with resource and draws, while appearing to be slippery. Each Enemy Phase, the game will give you evaluation whether you made the right choice or not.\r\n- Sometimes you are not sure should you move 1 and 1 again the next turn, or 2 this turn?\r\n- Adding to the fun and headache, we have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), [Scout Ahead](/card/08047), [Elusive](/card/01050), [Archive of Conduits](/card/08043) that help you with the movement.\r\n- We have [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) that let you virtually extend your movement range.\r\n- We have [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008) to help you ensure 1 evade to continue moving even when enemies are in the way.\r\n\r\nIf you love pathfinding and ahead of time calculation similar to when playing Chess, you will love the brainteaser of this character!\r\n\r\n# How to use [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008)\r\n\r\n- Exhaust does not cause the text box to become blank. You can still Fight again and again, just that exhaustion is the cost of auto-evade/+1 damage, you cannot do that multiple times. (Therefore, there is no incentive to normal-whip first then finish with auto-evade/+1 damage on your final whip in the turn.)\r\n- The decision to exhaust comes after a successful hit. You can retry as many times as you like to get the hit and proc either auto-evade or +1 damage. (On the contrary, [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) in this deck must declare +1 damage and spend evidence before the attack.)\r\n- Remember the Fast keyword.\r\n  - It does not cost any action to equip (just the resources)\r\n  - It also allows you to equip after drawing an enemy without getting AoO. Seeker often has multiple tools on hand and it is hard when to gear up for fight. With Fast, he can gear up after enemy is engaged with him and continue investigating freely with full 2-handed tooling.\r\n  - Allows you to pull out sick combo following weapons running out of its limited use, as if you always have a whip \"under\" any hand equipment as the 3rd slot. (It is trusty after all!)\r\n  - For example, use [Knife](/card/01086) throw <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> or shooting with [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) on its last ammo, while an another hand having [Ice Pick](/card/08105) to boost or [Flashlight](/card/01087)/[Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) planned to continue using after the fight, on the 2nd action. If that didn't defeat the monster, use Fast to play [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008) bumping out 0 ammo [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) or into the vacant slot from the [Knife](/card/01086), then use either whip +1 damage or whip-evade to survive an another turn.\r\n- Monster usually either have high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> or high <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, but not both. An another way to read the auto-evade hit is that you can evade by using your <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> against the monster's low <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and even deal 1 damage. If monster have low <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> and high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> instead, then you perform a regular Evade. With the whip, you can handle any enemy equally! (Without the whip, high <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> low <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy would be the worst for him to engage.)\r\n- Always think about moving even in a turn you are fighting with the whip. Resource gain or card draw makes a big difference sometimes. Therefore, Evade has extra value for Monterey as it allows him to exercise a bit for resource/draw and rejoin the fight next turn. Whip's auto-evade Fight was made for this.\r\n- If some unfortunate events cause it to be in discard pile, remember that [Professor William Webb](/card/08106) included in this deck can still recover it back.\r\n- [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) can boost accuracy because it uses <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> instead of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Auto-evade hit works even with Elite enemy. Using pump cards maybe critical to winning the scenario! (Especially that Monterey can get a lot of resources by moving.)\r\n\r\n## Delay fighting\r\n\r\nIt maybe your instinct that after drawing an enemy :\r\n\r\n- You have to finish it before continuing the investigation.\r\n- At least evade so you can fight it longer without taking damage.\r\n\r\nWith Monterey, sometimes both are wrong!\r\n\r\nYou can evade and move away, then **resume your job** even when that enemy is Hunter. (Also applies to true solo play, where there is no one else to take the enemy other than you.)\r\n\r\nRemember that evade will exhaust the enemy and it won't move, just readies. So you can do your job on the nearby location safely. However if it is a disengage (e.g. [Elusive](/card/01050) or [Archive of Conduits (Aldebaran)](/card/08043)) you may want to move away one more time since it would follow you.\r\n\r\nWhen it closes in, you evade again (preferably with your [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008)) and walk to do job in the other way. Monterey has advantage of gaining tempo while doing this with his ability. If the other clue gatherer try to do this, too much would be wasted on moving around.\r\n\r\n[Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s additional action for movement is critical to pull off this sort of thing.\r\n\r\n# Say NO to all optional cards!\r\n\r\nSince this is an [Underworld Support](/card/08046) deck where we benefit from smaller deck size, if the campaign optionally offer some cards, donate them all to the other investigator no matter how good it looks. You will be in pain when [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008) is not trusty and [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) is nowhere to be found!\r\n\r\n# Staying on the move with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)\r\n\r\nMonterey has special synergy with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s extra action. Leo is great when the extra action does not require any chaos bag pull. He should mainly use it to move to trigger his passive resource + card pump.\r\n\r\nIn no time, you will make back [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s cost!\r\n\r\n## Fighting\r\n\r\nIt is discouraged to stay at the same location and fight + evade to survive until the enemy dies since you will lose out on your passive skill for multiple turns, even though evade saved you from damages.\r\n\r\nYou must stay on the move. Therefore, evade is critical not only you don't take damage, but so you can move afterwards and still consistently getting resource or draw bonus. The destination should have clues so he can get work done while wearing down the enemy slowly.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you should use the [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008)'s auto-evade exhaust when you can't finish it this hit, then move away to get the bonus. The next turn, you can move to close in, whip-exhaust-auto-evade, then move out, preferably to the other side so you get both draw and 1 resource. When the enemy has 2 HP left, use the +1 damage whip exhaust to finish it off.\r\n\r\nThis kind of heavy movement play is only possible with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). So save up resources for him!\r\n\r\n## Investigating\r\n\r\nTry to investigate multiple locations at once by moving back and forth as you drain clues simultaneously to get his bonus. [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) make this not too action hungry.\r\n\r\nWith [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) you can dance around location even while trying to drain multiple clues off one location and there is no more on nearby location.\r\n\r\n# [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) guide\r\n\r\nThe other ally we aim to use [Charisma](/card/01694) is [Michael Leigh](/card/08086).\r\n\r\nThis character makes the deck solo play compatible. [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008) is very accurate but has limited +1 damage hit. With [Michael Leigh](/card/08086), we can get both accuracy and +1 damage for one more time.\r\n\r\nThe most useful is to use [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008)'s +1 damage hit and use evidence together, dealing 3 damages in one hit. The key to prevent enemy piling up is to dispose it in the fewest actions as possible, so you can relocate with your remaining actions. 3 HP enemies will no longer be your obstacle that much.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind you have to commit his evidence before the attack, but whip's exhaust +1 damage can be decided after it does hit. If you fail, whip does not exhaust, but Michael loses evidence.\r\n\r\nRefilling [Michael Leigh](/card/08086)'s evidence is natural for Monterey as he investigates and refilling does not exhaust, only +1 damage does.\r\n\r\nHe also gives +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> so [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) became somewhat usable. Note that in the 2 packs we have, this base [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) is the only non-signature weapon he can equip. It is a fail-safe just in case you can't get a hand on the whip.\r\n\r\nLastly, in early scenario (even before you get [Charisma](/card/01694)) you will be glad to have his 3 horrors soak. Later we will add [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) to help taking horror hits instead of him.\r\n\r\n# [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) guide\r\n\r\nIf the deck didn't grant [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) for you and you are ended up with [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) + [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032), that is fine! Don't forget he gives +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> permanently as well. In effect, you will be more prepared to fix [Buried Secrets](/card/08009) should you stand at difficult location.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, should you say even or odd?\r\n\r\n- If still missing [Trusty Bullwhip](/card/08008), say \"even\".\r\n- If you just want a lot of draws, perhaps for commits, say \"even\". Majority of this deck is \"even\".\r\n- Inversely, if you want less hits for some odd reason, say \"odd\". Or you are looking for the following cards : [.41 Derringer](/card/01047), [Ice Pick](/card/08105), [Professor William Webb](/card/08104), [Backstab](/card/01051), [Scout Ahead](/card/08047).\r\n\r\nHe can often fish out [Archive of Conduits](/card/08033) to begin your pilgrimage early enough in the scenario. This card is difficult since it seems to come mid or late part in a scenario, and you have already done your job for many locations, making you give up and have to try again the next scenario. Soon, you will run out of scenario to research!",

Each one granting +1 stat of choice, and a cool \"killer move\" that will remove that +1 stat until you regain your composure.\r\n\r\nFor new players, you likely will get 1 more in the middle of campaign. If you do well, you may get an extra one near the end of the campaign because you reached 30 XP. This is assuming you may or may not reach 30 XP. If you do, congratulations! You may take anything as the 3rd one. Make sure to add one more [Burden of Destiny](/card/08015) when gaining a new Discipline.\r\n\r\nThis deck is intended so you take the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> one first, then <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> second. <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline grants you on-demand healing, and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> one grants you \"triple attack\" special move.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ❄ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP.

Sometimes Lily should cast spells, sometimes fight with magic-imbued pole, utilizing gas-adjustable flaming sword, or dance around the battle field with butterfly swords and clear out hoard of enemies. You want to see this vision of thematic Lily coming to life.\r\n- **Combo attacks**. Do everything above but in a **combo**. Combos are always cool. Don't you ever want to open with a sweeping kick followed by flaming pole of Cthugha in 1 action? \r\n- **Exciting tests against treacheries** since you have boosts for both kind of popular tests. (<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>)\r\n- **Offensive healing**. Healing is not cowardice. You don't heal because you want to save yourself. Instead, you intentionally use more self-damaging tactics because you know you can heal. (Also healing is great for new comers who may not be able to weight damage taking vs. committing to survive well enough.)\r\n\r\nHere are brief details on the killer moves of the 2 Disciplines chosen : \r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline : Alignment of Spirit](/card/08011a) : Heal 3 damages or horrors, at cost of taking 1 direct damage or horror (the opposite of what you healed). To get your spirit aligned again, avoid all damages/horrors for an entire round cleanly.\r\n- [<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline : Balance of Body](/card/08014a) : Triple attack/evade which must be \"different\". To regain your balance of body, see 0 enemies throughout an entire round. (Not just at the location you ended up at.)\r\n\r\n# The 5 splashes\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Beat Cop**</span>](/card/01518) \r\n\r\nWaiting to get [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) upgrade discount. Expensive to play but permanent +<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> from non-weapon is rare!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dodge**</span>](/card/01523) \r\n\r\nWaiting to get [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) upgrade discount. The upgraded version tests <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, so perfect when you move onto <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline later and getting +1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n1x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"Get behind me!\"**</span>](/card/08021) \r\n\r\nKind of wildcard slot. This one has synergy with your starting <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline as you can heal out the damage taken.\r\n\r\nAnother choice is [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) which has synergy with <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline, you can use it as a part of triple attack. But that Discipline comes later, I think [\"Get behind me!\"](/card/08021) makes the cut.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\nThis deck contains [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059).

But we used all the L0 <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> splashes for [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) materials. This purchase allows playing it as a part of \"triple attack\" since it has \"Fight\" in bold.\r\n\r\nRight now we have pruned out almost all the Arcane-related cards that were doing work with [Dragon Pole](/card/08060). (Now we have 2x [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025)) The remaining is [Arcane Initiate](/card/01563) and perhaps [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) that you can find other cards you like to replace if you get more XP.\r\n\r\n# Discipline Techniques\r\n\r\n## <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline\r\n\r\n### <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> General Tips\r\n\r\n- The turn where you used the healing move, it meant you just took damage/horror (the opposite one you just healed) and cannot flip back right away. At minimum, it is the end of the next round if you managed to do \"no damage\".\r\n- There are 2 obstacles for the \"no damage\" in a round that you can't easily control : The encounter deck draw at start, and your deck draw right before resource draw the end. (which there is a moderate chance of you getting Tekeli-li that deals damage/horror.) Newer players may underestimate the end Tekeli-li draw and planned to heal the next turn. Take this into account and commit to normal healing cards when you cannot afford to lose any more health or you know the deck is full of Tekeli-li right now.\r\n- Other than these, you can manually avoid walking into enemies or kill/evade it quick before it could do something to you. (Unlike <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline which you needs to be in a completely peaceful state to regain the killer move.)\r\n- Even if you assigned all damages to allies or assets, it is still counted that \"you\" have taken damage/horror this turn (but assigned somewhere else). So you cannot hide behind bulky tanking assets for risk-free flip back after healing. [You can read more about this rule here.](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Interpreting_You_When_Taking_or_Being_Dealt_Damage)\r\n\r\n### Mastering the healing move\r\n\r\nWhile you can think of healing normally as a fail-safe, with infinite uses like this, it is important that you make the most of it and even turn it into aggression. Let's take a look at these situations. (X and Y maybe either damage or horror.)\r\n\r\n- `3 X, 0-2 Y` : Great deal to heal right now, since you can remove all 3 as allowed and not putting the other one at risk.\r\n- `2 X, 0-2 Y` : Same great deal when you have EotE weakness that is treated as 1 point of damage/horror.\r\n- `0-2 X, 0-2 Y` : Bad deal since you don't get to heal all 3 provided and even cost the other one.\r\n- `4-6 X, 4-6 Y` : Too late to heal. It may seems tempting to try getting one down, then find an another occasion to get the other down. But remember that you pay the other one, which put you at risk of being defeated by direct damage/horror. Also, flipping the discipline losing your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> put you even more at risks of extra treachery damages/horrors.\r\n- `2-4 X, 2-4 Y` : This is around the point before it is getting \"too late to heal\".\r\n\r\nKnowing those situations, you can now \"make a play\" around your healing abilities.\r\n\r\nAnytime you have a peaceful turn, and your health/horror is at the \"bad deal\" for heal, think back  to the previous turns. Can you **achieve more** by tanking more damages?\r\n\r\nYou may think you should have been more aggressive and suicidal when the field was messy, so you don't waste the peaceful moment now that you can heal. You can't contribute easily on investigation other than using utility cards.\r\n\r\nRather than wishing you have more investigation stuff in the deck, leave it to your friend and be more aggressive so you can heal up while your friend gets to work on the clue. Anytime you ended up having to draw or take resource, thinking that investigating 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> vs 2 shroud probably fails (frost tokens are a tons of -1) and you have nothing else to do, that's when you know you should amp up your damage taking a bit.\r\n\r\n- Tanking by intentionally not using Evade action when you are down to the last action, and even successful Fight would not finish it off. Just Fight as your last action and take some damages, so workload that requires more chaos bag pull is reduced on the next turn. Your heal is 100% accurate.\r\n- Tanking by taking Attack of Opportunity to do valuable things such as activating location ability, activating Scenario Action Triggered Skill, playing assets or events while engaged.\r\n- Tanking by taking engagement from other investigator by walking into the location, and Engage on your final action. (So you don't take AoO, but take damage in the upcoming Enemy Phase.)\r\n- Using some cards in the deck that hurt yourself for good effect : [\"Get behind me!\"](/card/08021), [Ward of Protection](/card/01065), [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) (potentially), [Toe to Toe](/card/08020).\r\n\r\nIf enemies have balanced damage/horror stats, selectively tanking the right stuff weighting towards the EotE weakness you got (whether it is treated as 1 damage or 1 horror).\r\n\r\ne.g. You have [Leg Injury](/card/08131) in the deck which is 1 damage. By trying to get your damage counter to 2 before shifting to taking more horror (damages go into assets at this point), you have prepared for the moment Leg Injury would appear then you can heal them altogether by full 3.\r\n\r\n## <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline\r\n\r\n### <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> General Tips\r\n\r\nIt is unexpectedly hard to flip back this Discipline, compared to the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> one.\r\n\r\nYou cannot at any moment be in the same location with any enemy at any point, not just at your ending location. Of course, drawing an enemy will say good bye to flipping it back this turn unless you get an Elder Sign. You cannot start the turn with unfinished enemy either, even if you managed to defeat it this turn, you have already be at the same location as a monster...\r\n\r\nAlso, it says nothing about engagement, so just by being at the same location as your friend that had drawn a monster would cause Lily to not gain back balance of her body... so make sure your triple attacks finish the fight beautifully.\r\n\r\n### Mastering the combo attack\r\n\r\nIt let you take 3 **different** Fight and Evade in 1 action. Therefore if you just punched an enemy using actions normally 2 times, you use this as the last one, you can punch it 3 more times dealing a maximum of 5 damages..?\r\n\r\nNot so! The biggest quirk of this awesome looking move is the \"different\" keyword. If you are fighting 1 enemy with no weapon, you can punch it only once, because the next one would be \"the same\". (Called \"basic action\", basic Fight.) No matter if it dies on that attack or not, you would have to throw away the 2 remaining moves if you have nothing \"different\" to do. You can think that a combo in fighting game built from spamming the same action looks lame and Lily refused to be a lame fighting game character.\r\n\r\n- Basic tactics to get 3 different Fight fully is for one basic, one from your 2-handed weapon ([Dragon Pole](/card/08060)/[Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025)), and one from [Brand of Cthugha (1)](/card/08090). Remember that Cthugha goes to your arcane slot, therefore not clashing with your 2-handed weapon.\r\n- Remove the basic fight from the above combo and left one for Evade. Remember that you cannot repeatedly attempt basic evade until you succeed on high speed enemy, because it would violate the \"different\" rule.\r\n- Performing basic Fight to a different enemy **does not make it different**. Therefore, considering at least mixing in Evade in your plan if you have no weapon for a different Fight, when you miss at least you avoid taking damage in the upcoming Enemy Phase.\r\n- Any card with \"Fight\" or \"Evade\" that plays from hand counted as \"different Fight\". It costs resource to do this in your combo attacks, but can be clutch! 3 cards in the Side Deck is included as a suggestion if you want to try this : [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) (you get thematic point bonus), [Toe to Toe](/card/08020), and [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029). We talk about this later in the \"Card-by-card explanations\" section.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**In the Thick of It**</span>](/card/08125) \r\n\r\nThis is an **important card** for this deck. With only Revised Core and EotE, it is very tempting to add 2x [Scrying](/card/01061) or even 1x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) in order to increase the chance to power your key weapon [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) to 2 arcane for that +1 damage. Your life depends on this.\r\n\r\nWith [In the Thick of It](/card/08125)'s 3 experience :\r\n- Include 2x [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) (an arcane that can power the [Dragon Pole](/card/08060)) right from the start, which is also a setup for [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) advantage. Playing cost is 2, which is lower than [Shrivelling](/card/01060). Plus you can still use <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, unlike [Shrivelling](/card/01060). These Cthughas very likely net you more experiences in first few scenarios.\r\n- Include [On the Trail](/card/08084), which helps investigating and a setup for [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) also.\r\n- This [<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline](/card/08011a) Lily can heal out the trauma! In the first few turns where it is still peaceful, you have high chance to heal out the effect from trauma and flip back the Discipline quick enough. Choose 2 **mental** trauma as the cost.  Lily has balanced 7 health and 7 sanity, the reason for choosing mental trauma is because of [Ward of Protection](/card/01065), an additional horror from it will make it 3, which is at the best value target for your healing skill.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Dragon Pole**</span>](/card/08060) \r\n\r\nYour main quest is to get this pole then find [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090), [Scrying](/card/01061) (cost just 1), and [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) to power it. Pole gives you +1 arcane slot, so you can even equip both copies of Cthugha while wearing [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116).\r\n\r\n[Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can help finding your [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) and [Scrying](/card/01061).\r\n\r\nAlways ask your friend if they have got the other copy of [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) in their **opening hand**. Because if they do, the talisman's ability allows equipping on any investigator at the same location. And you start the game on the same location. This is a very reliable way to get 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> head start on the pole.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dodge**</span>](/card/08026) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\n- Think of it as an increased chance of flipping <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline back. It is a good idea to use the healing move when you have Dodge on hand because you have higher chance of \"no damage\" a round.\r\n- You can dodge a Retaliate attack.\r\n- Read the text carefully, it means you can play it to make any other investigator dodge. (May not make sense initially but think of it as you yelling \"Bob! Avoid to the left!\")\r\n- Upgraded [Dodge](/card/08026) can still be used for other investigators. Meaning that your friend that draws an enemy can left it with 1 HP left, do something that provoke AoO at the same location as you, then you play this in order to finish it off with 1 damage.\r\n- Upgraded [Dodge](/card/08026) has 0 cost as opposed to 1 in the original version. Very reliable card. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"Get behind me!\"**</span>](/card/08021) \r\n\r\nOther investigator can drop an enemy on you, by doing anything that would provoke AoO on the same location as you, then you use this card.\r\n\r\nThe horror nullifying effect can be interesting. Many enemies have balanced attack and horror. By removing/lowering the horror, it let you plan out your target 3 damages, 0 horror \"good deal\" healing easier, compared with both going up at the same rate and you would put one at risk after healing.\r\n\r\nIf an enemy only deals horror, it can even contribute to the chance of getting \"no damage\" in order to flip the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> discipline.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Brand of Cthugha**</span>](/card/08092) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nThis weapon's selling point is that normally stuff that deals +1 damage like guns would rapidly lose its ammo even if you can't win <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> test. This one let you try until you can, then crank up the gas only after the blade is stuck inside the enemy. Cool! You can think of it as 3 ammo, but also you can use less charges when finishing off low health enemy.\r\n\r\nIt is an arcane, so very useful in contributing to your unlimited use [Dragon Pole](/card/08060). This is the reason using In the Thick of it worth a lot because you get to start with 2 of these. Remember that you **do not discard** this arcane once it runs out of charge. It gets to slot in as a materia in your pole forever.\r\n\r\nWith the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline you have 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, which is great, but grants no advantage on accuracy because your <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is also 4.\r\n\r\nRemember that it says \"you **may** use <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> instead of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>\". You can choose **not** to use <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. When the discipline is currently flipped and you lose your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, you can still fight with base 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> Cthugha, and also still get the +1 skill value.\r\n\r\nAfter you have obtained <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline, the triple attack combo can mitigate the \"succeed by 0\" weakness which cause you to lose action. When you use the combo as the last action, you are granted 3 \"not really action\", which you can now position Cthugha on the 1st or 2nd among those 3 Fight/Evade without fear of losing following actions that you have planned. (It loses the \"real\" action, that you already exhausted.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Holy Rosary**</span>](/card/01559) \r\n\r\nRequired to get 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, so you have an advantage over your <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> when using [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blinding Light**</span>](/card/01566) \r\n\r\nBenefits from additional willpower from the discipline and the [Holy Rosary](/card/01059). Remeber that before you can acquire the other Discipline, you have just 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. Now you can go up to 4 or 5 for critical evasion. Later on this card would be phased out when upgrading.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Drawn to the Flame**</span>](/card/01564) \r\n\r\nThis is your (rare) chance to help contributing in clues! Try grabbing clues from high shroud location.\r\n\r\nSome scenarios need clues used from the investigator at a particular location, not just spend as a group to advance. If Lily has 2 clues it can be time saver, not having to wait for friends with clues to arrive.\r\n\r\nThis card begs yourself to take damage from a treachery, which means you should not use it on a turn that you are hoping to flip back the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline. (And great to use when you had already took damage this turn, perhaps from using the healing or is going to use the healing.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Scrying**</span>](/card/01561) \r\n\r\nThis card is in the deck initially just to power your [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) more reliably. When you get [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025) or its upgrades, it is time to replace this.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Talisman of Protection**</span>](/card/08116) \r\n\r\nNotice that this is both asset and arcane, therefore very good to power the [Dragon Pole](/card/08060)! Also it is fast, meaning that you can delay playing it even until after you had drawn an enemy. Fast means you do not take AoO for equipping it while engaged. (Make sure to save 2 resources for this.)\r\n\r\nThere is only 1 copy in the deck because the other one should go to the other investigator in your team. The text allows equipping it to friends in the same location, therefore having it on others will increase the chance of full-powering your [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) more than hogging it all for yourself. (Or they can equip it when you got it first.) Especially on the starting hand, you are already bunched up at the same location.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Initiate**</span>](/card/01563) \r\n\r\nThis classic card can find : [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090), [Blinding Light](/card/01066), [Ward of Protection](/card/01065), [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) in the starting deck, and additionally [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029) in the upgrade. Though, [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) is not a Spell.\r\n\r\nThis card can be replaced later, but finding [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) fast is always helpful. (In EotE, you will be going through Tekeli-li draws, and this card can help you temporarily get through them.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Beat Cop**</span>](/card/01528) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nPermanent <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> buff! Upgraded version can help you kill stuff efficiently as well.\r\n\r\nCan be used to bump out [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) along with the doom due to 1 Ally limit.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Ethereal Slip**</span>](/card/08108) \r\n\r\nThis is a utility card that is quite situational. It is a Spell so [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can get it.\r\n\r\nOther than getting to an already revealed location (that now has an enemy) faster, it can be used to remotely break engagement from your main clue gatherer. Just keep 2 locations distance and they can safely draw enemies. You swap with the monster and then prepare to fight as the monster walks back. (And this time you engage it.)\r\n\r\nI have used this in a very important moment in one of EotE scenario!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Meditative Trance**</span>](/card/08061) \r\n\r\nThis is probably the weakest card in the starting deck and would be replaced quick. I found that on average, I would get to heal 2. Heal 2 for 2 resources is quite expensive. You can mix healing horrors and damages.\r\n\r\nBut can be worth it when you had taken high amount of both damages and horrors, making healing move now risky as it would increase one side further to your defeat. This card can take the situation back to \"healable\" once more.\r\n\r\nLastly, this can cure the new EotE weaknesses that is equivalent to 1 damage or 1 horror.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**On the Trail**</span>](/card/08085) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThis is included to take advantage of [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) and also the last chance to help investigating other than [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064).\r\n\r\nThe upgraded version let you move and grab clues. As a fighter, you likely want to move and help peeling enemy off your friends anyway. So overall the upgrade fits with the character, while the base version maybe a bit clunky.\r\n\r\nYou have to move \"toward\" the enemy for both moves. If you are right next to it with an another detour path near you, then you must move to it. You cannot voluntarily take a detour and back in order to grab more clues. So, some planning is needed to get the most clues.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) \r\n\r\nClassic and always useful, and you can heal back that horror cost! If you are trying to use it, it is the best when you are at 2 horrors so you can heal 3 after using it immediately.\r\n\r\nRead the treachery carefully if it disappear at the end of round or is more sticky. The sticky one is often worth cancelling. You must also look for \"Revelation\" to determine if you could cancel it or not. You cannot cancel enemy draw with this card!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Butterfly Swords**</span>](/card/08030) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••••</span>\r\n\r\nHas exhaust option to perform super attack with very high accuracy, but you must go through chaos token draw once again. The first attack can miss as well and you can still exhaust it to \"dance\" and have a go again with better chance.\r\n\r\nEven after you exhaust it, you can still use the Fight command and get +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> again and again until your action runs out, because exhaust is the \"cost\" of the 2nd attack. You just cannot do that part. It is not that exhausting the sword will make an entire text box blank. (Though this will be weaker than powered pole.)\r\n\r\nYou can choose different target for the 2nd attack. It can be handy in swarming situation, especially together with <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline's combo attack move.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Defensive Stance**</span>](/card/08024) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nGain tons of icons with just a commit of this. It is the most useful when helping your friend (mostly to beat <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treacheries) as you can only help with 1 card while at the same location. This 1 card packs a lot!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Fang of Tyr'thrha**</span>](/card/08029) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nWarp strike for 4 damage! It also says \"may move\", so instead of warping, you can throw this homing knife to dispose an enemy up to 4 HP.\r\n\r\nIt is a Fight, meaning that it is possible to perform in <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline combo to suddenly go to different location mid-combo. (COOL) You don't take AoO if used while engaged also because of Fight.\r\n\r\nYou can select the same enemy you are currently fighting with right now. Or you can select a different enemy far away, which the engaged enemy will warp together with you because it is currently on your threat area. (You don't drop it behind.) So also useful to take danger away from friends.\r\n\r\nThis is a late game toy, purchase only if you have got all upgrades mentioned in [Upgrade guide](#upgrade-guide) section done.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Sweeping Kick**</span>](/card/08023) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThis is all around good offensive + defensive card in one. Notice the Fight, you don't take AoO using this while engaged and also you can use it in the middle of <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline combo. Style point!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Toe to Toe**</span>](/card/08020) \r\n\r\nBecause you intentionally take damage as a cost for using this card, you can think of this as free test-less attack when you have some damages to go before you reach that 3 threshold.\r\n\r\nGood deal if you use the healing move right after this card in the same turn, so you can try the \"no damage\" on the next turn to flip back <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> Discipline.\r\n\r\nAlso because of bold Fight keyword, you can use this in the middle of <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline combo attacks for guaranteed damage.\r\n\r\nThis card costs 0, but due to already running out of 5 Guardian cards quota at the beginning, you have to purchase this one for 1 + 1 XP. (Due to [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059)) Can also be swapped with [\"Get behind me!\"](/card/08021) at start if you like.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n- [Lockpicks](/card/01687) is **the most important purchase** since it will power [Scavenging](/card/01073) to get Item stuff back! Spend your 2 XP for these ASAP!\r\n- [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) is to replace [Baseball Bat](/card/01074). Lockpicks can bump the gun out for [Scavenging](/card/01073) then you get a new set of ammo, and vice versa.\r\n- [The Red Clock](/card/08053) and [Precious Memento](/card/08115) is your late game ultimate toys (also Item). [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) allows you to flex with multiple accessories while you are trying to recover the 3rd one in the discard pile.\r\n- [Cheat the System](/card/08050) get it anytime you feel like. Also depends if you can get other colors from your teammates or not. Having resources from this is in order to prevent [Greed](/card/08018).\r\n\r\n# [Short Supply](/card/08071) guide\r\n\r\nDump your deck instantly on start so [Scavenging](/card/01073) has something to dig immediately.\r\n\r\n- If you are not the first player to go after scenario's start, you do not discard until your turn arrives. It occurs at the beginning of your turn.\r\n- The worst card to have it discarded is [Scavenging](/card/01073) since that is the whole point of [Short Supply](/card/08071). When you see 1 or 2 copies going away, you have to adjust your gameplay to be more careful accordingly.\r\n- You should be happy when seeing Items get discarded, because you will now have a choice to select according to the current situation with [Scavenging](/card/01073). Remember that [Flashlight](/card/01087) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687), a very important tool for [Scavenging](/card/01073), is also an Item.\r\n- If you see your signature weakness [Greed](/card/08018) discarded, you may now play aggressively in term of remaining resources.\r\n- If your signature [Shrewd Dealings](/card/08017) is gone, it would be less fun but not as impactful as 2x [Scavenging](/card/01073) gone.\r\n- When you run out of deck, you can reshuffle back at cost of 1 horror as per [the rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Drawing_Cards). This is the only option if you got bad [Short Supply](/card/08071) that you cannot scavenge. (If you can, then the deck won't run out that easily.)\r\n  - Reshuffle rule states that taking horror came after reshuffling and drawing a card from your fresh deck. This detail maybe important if you are playing EotE campaign, where you may get Tekeli-li.\r\n  - The horror taken is not direct. You can assign it to your assets.\r\n\r\n# Ways to use his ability\r\n\r\nBob's specialty is using the \"Item\" trait, which he has an extra action to play every turn.\r\n\r\n- Play from other member's hand onto their play area. That is, it is as if they had played it themselves, however using Bob's extra action. This results in everyone in the team asking if Bob wants to use that extra action or not, if not, Bob should play first and use extra action to play so the main fighter has 3 full actions to do things.\r\n- This \"play for\" strategy can even share the cost. Can be useful to help Guardian get an expensive weapon online fast.\r\n- An inverse is also possible, when Bob play an item for himself using extra action, he can borrow resource of other investigators.\r\n- When Bob play Item for others onto their area, if that investigator is engaged, Bob can get around AoO that that investigator would have to take in order to equip Item. Normally fighter will have to anticipate encounters and gear up before bad stuff show up. With Bob, you have more flexibility to use your gear up actions to make progress then gear up later when enemy appears.\r\n- On the first turn where you are still grouped up together, it is wise to talk with Bob if he could use an extra action to equip for other and let him take turn first before you split up. If fighter mulligan for huge weapon, sharing resource now is advantageous since it will left some resources for the fighter to use utility cards.\r\n- The little paragraph at first basically says normally you are not supposed to just show your hand to Bob if you have anything useful, unless you meet up first. Player can violate this \"immersion\" rule, but it is pretty fun to follow it! Before you meet up, you can still say something like \"Bob let's meet up, I have cool stuff you could use/I want you to pay for!\" Without saying what cards are on your hand.\r\n\r\n# Ways to use his signature : [Shrewd Dealings](/card/08017)\r\n\r\nInstantly turn your table into fruit salad because now everyone can have your Survivor and Rogue Item in play.\r\n\r\nCombined with his regular ability, this also allows playing Item of anyone to anyone. Rainbow!\r\n\r\nLook for cards with \"Synergy\" trait which benefits from having many colors in your control. Bob can make this worthwhile, especially when playing a multi-class card that grants multiple colors at once.\r\n\r\nAlso look out for 1-cost card, which would get discounted to 0. 0 is much better than 1 because it does not matter if treacheries unexpectedly drain your resource or something, you can always play it most of the time.\r\n\r\nAn example of good [Shrewd Dealings](/card/08017) card is to take [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025) from your fighter, since Bob has <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to add to the attack, he can easily join in the fight. (Though not for long, he loves his [Lockpicks](/card/01687) in his hand.) Look for more cards like this that seemed to be balanced because Rogue/Survivor cannot take it, but now Bob could. Deckbuilding requirements does not apply outside of deckbuilding!\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) \r\n\r\nGenerally helps with triggering [Scavenging](/card/01073). When you have got [Lockpicks](/card/01687), you can decide whether to remove this or not. \r\n\r\nPlay for other fighters early (e.g. the first few turns when you are still together) when they are not armed with big weapon just yet. The fighter can now drain 2 shroud locations together with you.\r\n\r\nWhen that fighter equips a weapon while having your Flashlight, try to bump the Flashlight out so it go back to Bob's discard pile ready for [Scavenging](/card/01073). Note that Flashlight is not automatically gone when out of battery, so bumping out is quite important.\r\n\r\nAlso per the [rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Slots), you cannot intentionally bump out Flashlight if you have an another hand free, when equipping 1 handed weapon. Guardian may have 2 handed weapon that make discarding your Flashlight easier.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Talisman of Protection**</span>](/card/08116) \r\n\r\nGreat Item to help not dying from [Greed](/card/08018), which you can [Scavenging](/card/01073) back.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Heavy Furs**</span>](/card/08126) \r\n\r\nI keep forgetting to use the \"reroll\" ability on this coat, so don't be like me.\r\n\r\nIf you get <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> when using [Baseball Bat](/card/01074), this can help keeping it. Other investigator would love to wear this as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bandages**</span>](/card/08073) \r\n\r\nAlly healing is useful when that ally seems to be balanced by it taking damages. Try giving this to Guardian with [Beat Cop](/card/01528) or [Guard Dog](/card/01021)!\r\n\r\nNote that it cannot do anything with horror. Only damage.\r\n\r\nRemember to discard it once out of supplies, so you can [Scavenging](/card/01073).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Schoffner's Catalogue**</span>](/card/08072) \r\n\r\nBob get better deal since he can discount the play cost of catalog with [Shrewd Dealings](/card/08017).\r\n\r\nThe 2nd paragraph means it is also possible for the other investigator to walk into your location, play an Item, then take the catalog out of your hand to pay for it. This can greatly shorten your prepare turn by using the catalog together.\r\n\r\n(e.g. Bob's turn, he play Item for others with [Shrewd Dealings](/card/08017) discount and sharing money, perhaps using some of the catalog. Then other investigator's turn, they can still play Items using Bob's catalogue, make it run out of secrets, sending it quick to Bob's discard pile for [Scavenging](/card/01073).)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**\"Hit me!\"**</span>](/card/08112) \r\n\r\nThe point is to try getting [Scavenging](/card/01073) without a lockpicks or a flashlight. If the first one you draw is 0 or -1, it is time to go for this card to let the negative takes you up to oversucceeding range. (Don't forget to calculate together with the first token draw. That's why it is best when you get 0 first.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Elusive**</span>](/card/01550) \r\n\r\nHas no particular synergy with Bob or anything else until you get [Gené Beauregard](/card/08099), then moving can be clutch.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**.41 Derringer**</span>](/card/01688) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nReplaces [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) as your fighting weapon. When out of ammo, try bumping it out so you can [Scavenging](/card/01073) back.\r\n\r\nAlways remind yourself that [Lockpicks](/card/01687) is on Hand slot. 2x Derringer and 2x Lockpicks will replace each other in cycle while you [Scavenging](/card/01073), granting you fresh guns and fresh lockpicks consistently.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Cheat the System**</span>](/card/08050) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\n[Greed](/card/08018) protector. Try getting many classes by using Bob's ability to get other investigator's assets.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Elder Sign Amulet**</span>](/card/01595) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\n[Greed](/card/08018) protector. Purchase late game, after [Precious Memento](/card/08115) because that can also tank horrors.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Eon Chart**</span>](/card/08098) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>, <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Eon Chart**</span>](/card/08100) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\n- When you take \"investigate\" choice, you can use the one on your [Flashlight](/card/01087) or [Lockpicks](/card/01687) as well. Not just a \"basic investigation\" one.\r\n- Move can combo with [Gené Beauregard](/card/08099).\r\n- The (4) version force you to take 2 choices. You cannot take just 1 choice.\r\n- The (4) version you must take 2 different choices. It cannot be 2x moves, etc.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Gené Beauregard**</span>](/card/08099) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThis card is so versatile, it will depends on the campaign should you push or pull clues when you move.\r\n\r\nJust don't confused about location, it talks about the location you ended up at after the move. (That location, and all connecting locations of that location. Nothing to do with the location you just left from before the move.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Precious Memento**</span>](/card/08115) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nNote that this is a \"FUTURE LIFE\" version. You can chose any you like. The first highlight of this card is it is an Item therefore you can recurse with [Scavenging](/card/01073) and repeatedly tank 3 3.\r\n\r\nSecond, the icon <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> means [Scavenging](/card/01073) can turn this into infinite [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) if you think you have enough tanking on you. Remember that committing will make it go to discard pile for [Scavenging](/card/01073) faster than playing it for soak.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Relic Hunter**</span>](/card/01695) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nRequired so you can have [Precious Memento](/card/08114) and [The Red Clock](/card/08053) online at the same time. Also you may receive useful Accessory Item from other investigators, such as [Holy Rosary](/card/01059).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**The Red Clock**</span>](/card/08053) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span><span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>\r\n\r\nFun cycling buff that I think the most useful is the first clock tick, the +3 skill value. Reason is obviously to ensure [Scavenging](/card/01073) success. It can be clutch if you can't quite get [Lockpicks](/card/01687) going just yet.\r\n\r\nAlso remember that [.41 Derringer](/card/01688) is also an excellent target to get that +3, since it could grant you an extra action!\r\n\r\nThe 2 moves and extra action are less important, which if the situation is tight I suggest you reset the clock often to get that +3.\r\n\r\n2 moves can be great with [Gené Beauregard](/card/08099), or generally to meet up with your other investigators for [Schoffner's Catalogue](/card/08072) party and Item exchange, or even help fixing <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> weaknesses with your extra action clock tick.",

Plus it is extra cool when he use it with his signature [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006).\r\n\r\nMainly, [Snipe](/card/08087) became usable with this Roland as he can use his [Red Tape Directive](/card/90026) making it fast, so not to waste an action aiming his gun. You of course should use [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) with this action as it is less likely to be wasted.\r\n\r\nWe also ensure he could run other spy-like <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> tricks such as [Backstab](/card/01051), [Elusive](/card/01050), and [Sneak Attack](/card/01052). They are normally anti-synergistic with Roland given his 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, but we don't care as we are trying hardest to be in line with the theme here. Cards like [Combat Training](/card/03107), [Defensive Stance](/card/08024), and [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) are included so he can finally land that elusive [Backstab](/card/01051) or evade for [Sneak Attack](/card/01052).\r\n\r\n[Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) or [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) is prohibited as it is not sneaky. [Machete](/card/01020) cannot be used as it is not a spy weapon. He must have 0 Ally card as spy operates alone. He sports 1 hidden [Knife](/card/01086) that must not be removed on upgrade since it is a spy's last resort weapon. And lastly, [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) is a must. A spy should be cunning and have a boiled chicken hidden somewhere with him.\r\n\r\nHe is chock full of Events and is completely naked elsewhere. He is likely broke from playing all the events and therefore a thematic [Sleuth](/card/08121) must be purchased 2x ASAP to help him play these events turn after turn.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ❄ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP.

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nThe starting deck has the following cards since his parallel back provide free 5 starting XP :\r\n\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">Sweeping Kick</span>](/card/08023) • : Make it possible to [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) in the first scenario, though the total cost is high without [Sleuth](/card/08121). Save up to perform this sequence on the big enemy with a victory point.\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Snipe</span>](/card/08087) • : Make the most use of your bullets. Keep [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to use when the bag became plenty of 0s.\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">Extra Ammunition</span>](/card/01526) • : Try hold onto your empty gun and wait for this.\r\n\r\n# Directives\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Red Tape**</span>](/card/90026) : Core card so you can play Tactic events with [Sleuth](/card/08121) often. Also try utilizing the <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window after Hunter enemy move but before it attacks. If it is enough for the enemy to die ([Backstab](/card/01051)/[Sweeping Kick](/card/08023)), you basically avoid damage and save an action of walking into it. (Therefore do not use Red Tape inside your Investigation Phase as it would exhaust.)\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Due Diligence**</span>](/card/90025) : This basically give him 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to evade and then Fast [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) it with Red Tape.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Leave No Doubt**</span>](/card/90029) : This simply adds +3 sanity making him able to withstand several failed [Cover Up](/card/01007), as this Roland is not exactly good with getting clues. You can still use [On the Trail](/card/08085) as it moves exactly twice.\r\n\r\n# Advanced?\r\n\r\nI have included [Advanced Roland's .38 Special](/card/90030) and [Advanced Cover Up](/card/90031) for your reference in the Side Deck. It is not required, deck should function the same with normal or advanced version.\r\n\r\nBut I would take the Advanced version, because [Directive: Leave No Doubt](/card/90029) basically let you fail at [Advanced Cover Up](/card/90031) more often and the penalty is still the same as the original version. An upgraded gun with a chance of refilling ammo is absolutely worth it.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Sleuth**</span>](/card/08121) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important card to find and put down, I would always hard mulligan for this. (e.g. Even willing to mulligan away his [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) to find [Sleuth](/card/08121).)\r\n\r\nMany Events in this deck are at 2 cost or lower, so the regenerating resources can cover them completely. Having it down allows you to save up resources to play your guns instead of having to save up for events.\r\n\r\nIf you have so many spare resources to put 2 copies down, you can discount all 3 cost of [Backstab](/card/01051) and even use 1 more to boost the test value. [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) also has a test to boost. And even cooler that you can play [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) at only 5 - 2 - 2 = 1 cost. (!!)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Roland's .38 Special**</span>](/card/01006) \r\n\r\nShoot with [Snipe](/card/08087) for the peak moment of your life.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**.45 Automatic**</span>](/card/01516) \r\n\r\nTry saving up money with [Sleuth](/card/08121) down to cycle this gun, while using events from [Sleuth](/card/08121) resources to fend off enemies.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dodge**</span>](/card/01523) \r\n\r\nThis is important to protect the [Combat Training](/card/03107) composure as a stray horror without any ally would destroy the composure. Later we add [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) to help.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/01525) \r\n\r\nUse it with [Snipe](/card/08087) to improve a chance of landing bonus damage with minimal commits.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Extra Ammunition**</span>](/card/01526) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nOne copy to give you a chance to refill his [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Elusive**</span>](/card/01550) \r\n\r\nOne copy left after the upgrade. Not much combo asides from being spy-like, as it is already Fast and not needing the Red Tape.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Backstab**</span>](/card/01551) \r\n\r\nLooks awful and cost prohibitive until you have [Combat Training](/card/03107) and [Sleuth](/card/08121), where you then have reasonable chance to land the <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> hit.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Sneak Attack**</span>](/card/01552) \r\n\r\nGet the enemy to exhaust with [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023), [Defensive Stance](/card/08024) evasion, or [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Cunning Distraction**</span>](/card/01578) \r\n\r\nMainly you will just commit this for <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery defense, but with [Sleuth](/card/08121) down there is a chance that you can afford to play it for real. Red Tape also save you an action. If you perform [Sneak Attack](/card/01052), an entire combo is automatic.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) \r\n\r\nIf possible **do not** throw it, keep it as a lucky charm. Because this deck is very bare on the equipments, when asset-losing treachery strikes, then you will be able to choose the knife. Empty gun should not be discarded unless [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) had already gone.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Sweeping Kick**</span>](/card/08023) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nA key card to land an exhaust because it adds <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to your acceptable <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. After, you can use [Sneak Attack](/card/01052).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Snipe**</span>](/card/08087) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nUse Red Tape to save an action then you can perform accurate hit with your gun. Even if you have used Red Tape for something else, it can be use mid-fight since text says ignore AoO. (But cost an action.)\r\n\r\nFind [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to pair with and look for a 3 HP enemy to perform a low-commit killing attack.\r\n\r\nRemember that it uses one of your 2 plays restriction on your Red Tape directive.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Sure Gamble**</span>](/card/01556) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nA cool but expensive card that allows him to do the impossible, that is evading or landing a [Backstab](/card/01051).\r\n\r\nBeware that this is not compatible with [Sleuth](/card/08121), you must keep 2 resources to play it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Elder Sign Amulet**</span>](/card/01595) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nAn important [Combat Training](/card/08027) protector.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Defensive Stance**</span>](/card/08024) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nAllows Roland to basic evade and exhaust an enemy to use that [Sneak Attack](/card/01052), when Due Diligence is not quite enough or already used.\r\n\r\nHe can also land a [Backstab](/card/01051) with +4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> added, this is similar to the effect of [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) but inverted.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Combat Training**</span>](/card/08027) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nAdds the important <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> boost so you can land the [Backstab](/card/01051) hit easier. Use [Dodge](/card/01023) and [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) to protect the composure.\r\n\r\nAlso if you got a perfect game with 2x [Sleuth](/card/08121), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), and the guns down, it ensure you still have something to do with your resources by dumping them into the boosts.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**On the Trail**</span>](/card/08084) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>, <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**On the Trail**</span>](/card/08085) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nFollow the trail of your target which is awesome for [Sleuth](/card/08121) theme and also can be discounted by that. This is a few chance you can perform fancy investigation as he lose his kill-clue ability on his original front.\r\n\r\nBy using Red Tape making it Fast, you can drag the currently engaged enemies locations away since you avoided the AoO to play the card, and multiple moves inside the effect of this card won't trigger anymore AoO.\r\n\r\n# Investigator combos\r\n\r\nThere is no draw engine in this deck. Therefore if you can pair him with someone that can provide him card draws, he can have more events to play to keep up with his replenishing [Sleuth](/card/08121) resources.",

([Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) hitting it, [Research Librarian](/card/01032) have work to do, [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) hitting things, [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) is meaningful, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you got only 5 XP, choose [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) in higher player count and stay as support buffer then use spare 3 XP to make early purchase of [Charisma](/card/01694). Choose [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) in lower player count for better enemy spawn survival.\r\n\r\n# Stat buffs\r\n\r\nBy having \r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Scientific Theory</span>](/card/08040) •••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Prophesiae Profana</span>](/card/08045) •••••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Hiking Boots</span>](/card/08035) •\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Jeremiah Kirby</span>](/card/08032)  / <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Dr. Milan Christopher</span>](/card/01533) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Holy Rosary</span>](/card/01559) \r\n\r\nHer stats would become : 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, 7 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> (+1 when shooting the gun), and 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.\r\n\r\nNotice that everything except <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> are 4. By adding [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 on top, it is enough to perform at that task in Standard difficulty. The tricky part is that you can only choose 1 kind of stat per round. So try doing that multiple times if possible.\r\n\r\nRemember that [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) cannot be activate in defense of mythos draw, you need the skill cards for that. By having 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, it make sure [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) performs reliably as a treachery cancellation card as if you have [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\nTo equip the [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) though you will need to find [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008) first to put 2 books inside. Which we have a tutor card : [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032).\r\n\r\n# Playing with [The Necronomicon](/card/01009)\r\n\r\nUse her free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> each turn to move the horror if you are not engaged, or having [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) to ignore AoO. You must move the horrors onto your investigator card directly as it says \"to Daisy Walker\". [Scientific Theory](/card/03109) can add back 3 sanity defense.\r\n\r\nThe biggest effect is not the <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> to <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>, but the hand slot. Often it would bump your [.45 Automatic](/card/01016), you are lucky. If it bumps one of your core book [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) or [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) out, then you are screwed! As we only have 1 copy each as far as XP and deck slots allow.\r\n\r\nGetting [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008) quickly with [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) can prevent this problem as you can hold [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) in one hand and [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) in an another, while 2 core books are in the tote bag.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like it is coming, do not put down 2 books on both hands without [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008). Put down only [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) first for survival, since its ignore AoO can in turn fix [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) should it comes into your other hand.\r\n\r\n# Advanced?\r\n\r\nI would go for [Advanced Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/90002).\r\n\r\nIt save you some actions playing the books, and fast can be clutch if you have [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) down while engaged with enemy but no [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) yet. (Or having it on hand, waiting for 4 resources.) Then you got it, this tote bag allowing you to put it down Fast skipping AoO, immediately unlocks [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) reading in the face of monster, and fix the situation.\r\n\r\nIt also makes you a bit happier if you hit it by mistake on [Written in the Stars](/card/08034).\r\n\r\n[Advanced Necronomicon](/card/90003) takes the same 3 horrors to fix, and we have [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) to help moving the horror each turn with her free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> even while engaged with enemies, so it is over in 3 turns at most. 2x [Scientific Theory](/card/08040) can also give you back sanity after you move these horrors on to Daisy.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**.45 Automatic**</span>](/card/01516) \r\n\r\nYour new [Shrivelling](/card/01060)! This card can be tutored out with [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) calling even, making it much more likely that this Daisy is ready to defend herself. Though you will need [Scientific Theory](/card/08040) or [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) to get to acceptable accuracy that won't waste a bullet.\r\n\r\nIt is expensive and is not compatible with [Unearth the Ancients](/card/08039). \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/01525) \r\n\r\nUsing 2 of the 5 splash slots. This is helpful for [.45 Automatic](/card/01016)'s limited bullet to ensure you don't have to waste a 2 damages shot on odd-HP enemy.\r\n\r\nPray that [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) hit this card and try go to town with [Encyclopedia](/card/01042)!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Research Librarian**</span>](/card/01532) \r\n\r\nKey card to get your 2 books [Prophesiae Profana](/card/08045) and [Encyclopedia](/card/01042).\r\n\r\nWith [Charisma](/card/01694), you can use [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) to find him calling even, then put him down immediately to get the books. Costs a lot of resources though, but this will get better once you have [Unearth the Ancients](/card/08039) at the end.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Dr. Milan Christopher**</span>](/card/01533) \r\n\r\nOne copy is possible because [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) can get him by calling even.\r\n\r\nThis deck has no expensive event but a lot of expensive gear. Having this guy ensure you can replay [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) for more bullets or quickly put down all the books, especially with [Advanced Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/90002) providing Fast to put down books faster than you can gather resources.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Working a Hunch**</span>](/card/01537) \r\n\r\nDaisy is likely too poor to play this at 2 cost and would rather simply investigate. This is purely an attempt to get more [Perception](/card/01090) in the deck, but unlike [Perception](/card/01090) it can be hit by [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) calling even. Also improves the chance of [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) hitting 2 books.\r\n\r\nLater replaced with [Unearth the Ancients](/card/08039). It has the same useful icons, but with real benefit that you want to use, and still can be hit by [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) calling even. (0 is even)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Deduction**</span>](/card/01539) \r\n\r\nAlways a great card especially in this Daisy that sacrificed multi-clue gathering tricks for fighting. Pray that [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) hit this card.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Holy Rosary**</span>](/card/01559) \r\n\r\nOnly 1 copy can be sneaked in with 2x [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) and 2x [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) taking the 5 splashes. But [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) calling even can hit this.\r\n\r\nThe only accessory and the only thing that round out <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> in this deck. This deck has no spell to cast, this is purely for mythos defense as [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) cannot boost at that moment. It should be durable as Daisy has a lot of sanity to take.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01588), [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01693) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThis unpopular 2 XP upgrade became great with [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) as its 0 cost would hit calling even. It allows \"comboing\" after you get it out with Kirby to virtually give you enough resources to play what Kirby get you, while not reducing the overall cards you get since it has draw 1 to replace itself.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Jeremiah Kirby**</span>](/card/08032) \r\n\r\n**Call for EVEN.** This deck has been designed to hit many useful cards by always calling even. The only odd-costed card is [Written in the Stars](/card/08034). And it wouldn't hit the skill cards. This is nice as when you do get [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) on normal draw, you have more chance to reveal the skill cards.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Daisy's Tote Bag</span>](/card/90002)\r\n  - This is godsend, not many cards can tutor her tote bag.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">.45 Automatic</span>](/card/01516) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Research Librarian</span>](/card/01532) \r\n  - Put down immediately next to Kirby after you have [Charisma](/card/01694), to continue searching for critical books.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Dr. Milan Christopher</span>](/card/01533) \r\n  - We put in only 1 copy of him respecting that Kirby can get him, making some deck space for other cards, and reducing clunkiness of getting double Milan.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Working a Hunch</span>](/card/01537) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Hiking Boots</span>](/card/08035) •\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Unearth the Ancients</span>](/card/08039) ••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Scientific Theory</span>](/card/08040) •••\r\n  - This card replaces [Overpower](/card/01091) which have no cost and wouldn't hit Kirby search. 0 cost (even) and Fast make this a very good search hit. 3 XP spent on this will be well worth it with Kirby.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Prophesiae Profana</span>](/card/08045) •••••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Holy Rosary</span>](/card/01559) \r\n  - Only 1 copy possible due to using one of her 5 splashes, and this is the only Accessory card. So Kirby being able to hit it is very helpful.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01588), [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01693) ••\r\n  - This card's upgraded version shines with Kirby as the cost is 0 (even), and you can play it to continue sifting through deck with its added draw effect, making it looks like Kirby grants you some bonus resources!\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Heavy Furs</span>](/card/08126) \r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Bulletproof Vest</span>](/card/01594) •••\r\n\r\nAlso he has reverse stat from Milan, 2/1. This is better at protecting the [Scientific Theory](/card/08040) Composure. Though we would add [Charisma](/card/01694) anyway and you will be able to also have [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) on board.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Written in the Stars**</span>](/card/08034) \r\n\r\nSince this is a deck about rounded out stats, this card gets more benefits when played \"blind\" (don't know the top of your deck) as it is more likely that the icons you get will be beneficial to your quest.\r\n\r\nAfter you see which icons you get, then you decide to use [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 to take it further as needed, or if already enough, boost something else if you need other kind of stats in the same turn. (e.g. You want to evade first then investigate. [Deduction](/card/01039) was put on the stars, so you use [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) to add to your <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.)\r\n\r\n2 of her splashes devoted to [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) is also an attempt to make this play more powerful. If you got [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) on the stars, using [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) to add +2 more and even repeated basic fight can be clutch.\r\n\r\nThis card has synergy with [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) too as when calling even, it would filter out the asset cards you don't want on the stars, leaving the deck with skill cards.\r\n\r\nEven if you hit [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [Unearth the Ancients](/card/08039), or [Scientific Theory](/card/08040) by mistake, it still gives good icons.\r\n\r\nTry remember whether the following cards are still in the deck or not and decide on your own whether you want to risk it or not. You don't want to hit them :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">Prophesiae Profana</span>](/card/08045) ••••• : 1 copy, no way to get back other than deck-out.

      "description_md": "\"Destiny Draw\" is a Yu-Gi-Oh term for drawing exactly what you had wanted and it is a great feeling! [Underworld Support](/card/08046) together with Parallel Back Skids deck-building requirements let you build a deck with only 20 cards.\r\n\r\nExplanation for new comers to this game : Normal decks have around 30 cards. In typical deck, the scenario ends while you have around 5~10 cards in the deck. The problem is often that you don't get a certain weapon or expensive items you just bought until it is too late. Throughout the campaign, you may often feel like \"This sucks, card X didn't come out at all this scenario, and the previous scenario it came out way too late!\".\r\n\r\nA deck with 20 cards is going to feel very different as you get to see **every** cards in the deck on every campaign, and even **multiple times** when deck reshuffles. You can count on finding a certain card reliably without costing many turns.\r\n\r\nThe deck is centered around extremely expensive exceptional cards : [The Black Fan](/card/08057) and [The Red Clock](/card/08053). They worth the XP spent more than investigator with a larger deck because you see them often.\r\n\r\nOther cards are now extremely consistent as well. Any combo you want to pull off, each draw can get you closer faster than any other decks.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this deck is limited attack power, Skids only have basic weapons and his parallel back no longer have <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> access, so no more [Beat Cop](/card/01018) or [Machete](/card/01020). But you will be surprised how you can assemble **the same set of equipments** each play as contrary to regular deck.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ❄ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP.

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nIt may not look like much especially that we can only buy 1 copy each, but high amount of exceptional items takes up all the XP fast.\r\n\r\nBoth [Knife](/card/01086) and [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) are disposable and are good in thin deck when it reshuffles. Your choice whether to be more offensive or more defensive, changing the [Knife](/card/01086) removal to [Heavy Furs](/card/08126).\r\n\r\nUnlike normal sized deck, you **will** see [The Red Clock](/card/08053) and [Precious Memento](/card/08114) once you purchased them. Therefore these came very early in purchase priority, unlike other decks. It is really satisfying to always see your expensive purchases coming up reliably.\r\n\r\n[Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) can be replaced with [Hot Streak](/card/01057) if you want. The advantage is that you get to do it **again** when your deck loops back, but it gives you less money (since you spent 3 to play it) and cost 1 XP more.\r\n\r\nThis parallel Skids cannot use [Police Badge](/card/01027) unlike the regular deck-building requirements. [Moxie](/card/08056) takes that role. Granting <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> is great for [Savant](/card/08052). By filling Skid's weakest stat, [Savant](/card/08052) will start at <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>. Wild!\r\n\r\n## Specializing\r\n\r\nThe above's recommendation makes him a generalist who could fight and investigate. Depending on your party members, you may skew Skids towards clueing or fighting by :\r\n\r\n- Towards clue : Remove [Backstab](/card/01051) or [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) instead of [Perception](/card/01090). You may also try replacing [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) with [Gené Beauregard](/card/08099) with spare XP.\r\n- Towards fighting : Remove [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) or [Flashlight](/card/01087) instead of [Hard Knocks](/card/01049). This allows you to be independent of [The Red Clock](/card/08053)'s timing and 20+ resources on [The Black Fan](/card/08057) in some nasty turn to add +<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> on your own.\r\n\r\n# Empty investigator deck rule\r\n\r\nTo play this deck, you need to learn about [this rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Drawing_Cards) what to do when the deck runs out.\r\n\r\n- Nothing happen when the deck is empty, until you want to **draw** from it. \r\n  - This means if scenario effect instructs you to discard top of the deck while the deck is empty, you do not activate the reshuffle since it is not a drawing.\r\n- You take the horror cost **after** you draw. (And finished resolving revelation effect if it is a weakness.)\r\n- This horror is **not direct**. You can and should assign to [Precious Memento](/card/08114).\r\n\r\n# Equipment stabilizing\r\n\r\nIf you had played this game for a bit, you will notice that it is hard for the deck to grant you cards in an order that you idealized. This deck's highlight is that you often ended up in the state you want due to its extreme consistency, for **every** scenario. Even if the cards coming up are out of order, it does not matter as much since the correct one will come soon after making order irrelevant. You just need to hold onto them for only a moment.\r\n\r\nThis is the ideal state : \r\n\r\n- Hand 1\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**.41 Derringer**</span>](/card/01688) •• or [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) first then...\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Switchblade**</span>](/card/01544) bumps it out once out of charge.\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) Use the throwing move liberally, deck-out will revive this.\r\n- Hand 2\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**The Black Fan**</span>](/card/08057) •••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> always.\r\n- Body\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Heavy Furs**</span>](/card/08126) \r\n- Accessory\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**The Red Clock**</span>](/card/08053) ••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Precious Memento**</span>](/card/08114) ••••\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Relic Hunter**</span>](/card/01695) ••• : Enables equipping both at the same time.\r\n- In play\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Unscrupulous Loan**</span>](/card/08113) •••\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Bruiser**</span>](/card/08122) •••\r\n- On hand\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Money Talks**</span>](/card/08054) ••\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Savant**</span>](/card/08052) •\r\n\r\nThe mission on the first cycle of your deck should be obtaining this state. Use gambling wisely to reserve enough money. Because of small deck, you can **reliably plan** your money ahead of time and get to spend them. Unlike normal sized deck, things you saved up for may not come at all.\r\n\r\n(e.g. \"I need to find 3 resources ASAP because [Bruiser](/card/08122) is coming up! Then I can use its discount to play my [.41 Derringer(2)](/card/01688)...\")\r\n\r\n# Cards counting\r\n\r\nSpecial ability of 20 cards deck is that you can count on \"finding\" a certain card in the deck by natural draw or draw action reliably. This is a very fun experience, and it **rewards card counting**, like knowing a regular suit of cards what was used up and what's left.\r\n\r\nNormal decks would be a bit hopeless waiting for a certain card, and have to make do with the best of the current situation. It is not the same in this deck, you can actually wait for a certain card without costing that many turns.\r\n\r\nFor example, you have found a 5 shroud location that is critical to clear, and you know that [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) is not yet going to the discard pile. There is very high chance that spending draw action (Which [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) and [The Black Fan](/card/08057) can support.) will be able to perform such \"destiny draw\".\r\n\r\nOther cards worth remembering are : \r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Backstab</span>](/card/01551) : Often 3 damage is a critical number. Find [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), or [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) first to obtain good amount of <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icons to pull this move off.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Money Talks</span>](/card/08054) •• : When you are stuck with ridiculous scenario test which rewards you a campaign-long effect, this can solve it.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Cheat the System</span>](/card/08050) • : If you are missing just a bit more cash to get 20+ for [The Black Fan](/card/08057) and therefore granting you usable stats number, such as 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Bruiser</span>](/card/08122) •••, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Precious Memento</span>](/card/08114) ••••, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">The Black Fan</span>](/card/08057) •••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">The Red Clock</span>](/card/08058) •••••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> : These are items you need to put all down in order to come \"online\".\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Bruiser</span>](/card/08122) •••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Switchblade</span>](/card/01544) : This is the [Flashlight](/card/01087) / [.41 Derringer](/card/01688) \"bumper\", so you get a fresh copy when deck reshuffles. \r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Knife</span>](/card/01586) : The +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is unexpectedly handy for Skids with unboosted 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n# Advanced cards?\r\n\r\nParallel Skids came with \"Advanced\" version of both signatures. I would take the **normal version** due to :\r\n\r\n- [On the Lam](/card/01010)'s normal version also provides <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> for winning big in 3 resources gambling, the same as [Advanced On the Lam](/card/90009).\r\n- Paying for [Advanced Hospital Debts](/card/90010) can be risky, it may power down [The Black Fan](/card/08057).\r\n\r\n# Weakness problems\r\n\r\nIn 20 cards deck, you will rapidly draw your weaknesses. (In Standalone Mode, you will have even more concentration of them.)\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more to say other than, good luck! However keep in mind that seeing weakness early can bring you peace of mind. (Until the deck reshuffles.)\r\n\r\n## [Hospital Debts](/card/01011)\r\n\r\nThis card **stays in play** even if you already paid everything. Therefore, it benefits us since the deck can cycle back all it wants, this weakness would not be encountered ever again. Handy!\r\n\r\nBe careful of using your [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) money to pay the debts, causing you unable to pay back the loan. Loan is 3 XP to repurchase but the debt worth 2 XP. (Beware of supernatural source of resource losses as well.)\r\n\r\nTry using [The Black Fan](/card/08057) or [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s action to gather money bit by bit before it even came up. (Remember the number 6.) For example when you are tempted to investigate 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> vs. 3 shroud with nothing else to do, that action is better off used to grab some money in anticipation of drawing the debt. (You will 100% draw it in thin deck.)\r\n\r\nThese 6 resources can be used to power [The Black Fan](/card/08057) until right before clearing the scenario or being defeated, then you pay the debt and safely power down the fan. (If you are really rich you may still have 20+ even after having paid the debt.)\r\n\r\n## How to deal with [Paranoia](/card/01097)\r\n\r\nThis is absolutely brutal because with 20 cards, your deck will reshuffle fast. Over and over, your resource would keep resetting to 0 **multiple times in every scenario**.\r\n\r\nNot to mention [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) stays on the play field, which make you unable to get 10 resources again the next round of deck. (And you cannot pay the loan now.)\r\n\r\nOther than redrawing your weakness, I have prepared separated upgrade path and strategies if you want to take on this challenge : \r\n\r\n- [Hot Streak](/card/01057) should replace [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) (Cost 1 more). You can now gain back the resource on the new round of deck.\r\n- Give up [The Black Fan](/card/08057) purchase and go for the ultimate version of [The Red Clock (5)](/card/08058) (It costs the same 6 XP.) This version allows you to have +4 skill value \"on demand\" compared with weaker version that you need to anticipate one turn prior. Instead of holding onto money to power [The Black Fan](/card/08057), now you use them for pump cards : [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) + [Moxie](/card/08056), and [Money Talks](/card/08054).\r\n- You can decide to upgrade [Lucky!](/card/01080) to [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584), to get the draw which is good for going though thin deck, reaching money recovery cards faster after hitting [Paranoia](/card/01097). I would not choose to use his special \"left the lower version\" upgrade option, since it defeat the purpose of thin deck and dilute other cards.\r\n- Do not replace [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and [Hard Knocks](/card/01049).\r\n  - [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) : Together with [Cheat the System](/card/08050) to help fixing the loss on each iteration of deck. The upgraded [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/01693) is also an option, the same reason as [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584). \r\n  - [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) : Dump your resources for pumps in anticipation of incoming [Paranoia](/card/01097).\r\n  - What to replace instead? Clue tools such as [Flashlight](/card/01087), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), or [Lucky!](/card/01080) if your party has a dedicated clue finder, or either [Backstab](/card/01051) or [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) if you want to retain Skids's ability to get clues.\r\n- Get [Moxie](/card/08056) earlier, for the same reason as keeping [Hard Knocks](/card/01049), so you can pump before it dumps.\r\n- If the deck is thinning and you know [Paranoia](/card/01097) is right around the corner, save up resources on [The Red Clock](/card/08053) and reset the clock once [Paranoia](/card/01097) had passed to get some starting resources.\r\n\r\n# Obtaining resources\r\n\r\nTry to get 15+ to get [The Black Fan](/card/08057)'s extra action.\r\n\r\nFrom there, it is easier to climb to 20+ with resource action, where you finally get +1 to all skills, especially if you also have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), granting you 5 actions!\r\n\r\nHaving tons of actions does not equal quality action. Therefore these extra actions has great value if you spend them on something that does not require chaos bag pulling. (Move, Resource, Draw.)\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Unscrupulous Loan</span>](/card/08113) •••, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Cheat the System</span>](/card/08050) •\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, these cards are critical to set a new \"baseline\" of your money so you appears to need only a bit more to get [The Black Fan](/card/08057)'s extra action.\r\n\r\n[Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) stays in your control, you will not able to do it again when your deck resets. While you will likely see 2 or 3 [Cheat the System](/card/08050) in one scenario, which should grant you 3 resources each time.\r\n\r\nMoney from the loan should not be used until you obtained 15+ where you can get more money with [The Black Fan](/card/08057). [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) (Pay 6) and [Bruiser](/card/08122) (Pay 3) are probably instances where it worth dipping into the loan money temporarily, because they can set you up for success.\r\n\r\nOnce you have [Bruiser](/card/08122) down, each time [Cheat the System](/card/08050) came up you get a fast 3 resources. Remember that the deck probably cycles 1 or more time in a scenario, the 2nd time hopefully you will have [Bruiser](/card/08122) online already.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">The Red Clock</span>](/card/08053) ••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">The Red Clock</span>](/card/08058) •••••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>\r\n\r\nResetting the clock (in an attempt to get the awesome +3 skill value next turn) will grant you resources.\r\n\r\nNote that the +3 skill test can be used for gambling ability as well.\r\n\r\n## Gambling\r\n\r\nIn an unsure turn, you can try your luck by gambling by 1. Take note of special token effects as well as your little gambling addict could doom your party if not careful.\r\n\r\nUse [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), and [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) to gamble 3 and try to win big. Note that [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) is never replaced from the deck, its sole purpose is to give you <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for the gamble more often.\r\n\r\n[On the Lam](/card/01010) also gives a massive 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for gambling. While <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> cannot revive this card back, the deck recycling should allow you to have it again once more.\r\n\r\n# \"Polishing\" [Precious Memento](/card/08114)\r\n\r\n![Skids](https://github.com/5argon/AHLCG3mmDivider/blob/main/Etc/Weird/skids-memento.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe trick is using his gambling <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> to initiate a no-action test at 1 difficulty or even 0 in an attempt to get horror heal from the stone.\r\n\r\nWhen you put damages on the stone, it maybe harder to heal than horror. However if you are richer than 20 you can try to gamble for 3 resources without any commit, and beg for the bag to fail you big. It feels like paying 3 resources to heal 1, which sometimes needed to continue tanking critical damages. If you do succeed? You are happy from your reward money anyways!\r\n\r\nThe deck will cycle 1 or 2 times. Each time, try putting the horror deck reshuffling cost on this stone. (It is not direct.)\r\n\r\n# [The Red Clock](/card/08053) tricks\r\n\r\nThe highlight of this card is the +3 skill value on the **next** test, which is an enabler for [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) to get an extra action, or for [Switchblade](/card/01044) to get the coveted critical hit. ([Bruiser](/card/08122) also support this.)\r\n\r\nYou should try to read the future and reset the clock before you think you would need that +3, because the turn you reset you will not get any buff.\r\n\r\nIt is also handy for pulling off a clean [Backstab](/card/01051).\r\n\r\nThe last tech is that you may intentionally not taking any test (do not gambling either) in attempt to take the +3 to your next treachery draw. You maybe able to dodge bad <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests more often this way. (Try it when your sanity is getting to critical level.)\r\n\r\n# Elder Sign\r\n\r\nWhen drawing <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, you can \"revive\" cards of level 0, 1, and 2. I found that [Savant](/card/08052) is often the target so you can avoid <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery one more time.\r\n\r\nIf you are rich already then [Money Talks](/card/05029) is a no brainer.\r\n\r\nCard with no level cannot be revived. (White opaque thing instead of empty 5 pips.)\r\n\r\n# Cards that became good in thin deck\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) \r\n\r\nThis card is not a bad card in this deck since Skids's 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> often benefits a lot when getting +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> from the knife throw.\r\n\r\nSmall deck size will allow you to get back your thrown knife for 1 or 2 more times in a scenario.\r\n\r\nYou can put down [Switchblade](/card/01044) in its place even mid-fight after throwing.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Switchblade**</span>](/card/01544) \r\n\r\nThis weapon was the laughing stock of core set, since asking for +2 over-success from a <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> while the weapon not giving any bonus is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut this Parallel Back Skids with [Underworld Support](/card/08046), with only 2 packs available really lacks powerful weapon. One copy of [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) isn't going to cut it. We **need** to make this tiny knife work.\r\n\r\n- Timing with [The Red Clock](/card/08053) may grant 1 attack that deals 2 damage. (+3 or +4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>) This is better than it sounds, since it is a repeatable source of +1 damage.\r\n- [Bruiser](/card/08122) can support getting over-succeed once per turn. (Granting +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.)\r\n- [The Black Fan](/card/08057) with 20+ resources adds 1 more <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n- Lastly, pumping money into [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) while you still have it. (Replaced on upgrades.)\r\n\r\nThis card serves an another purpose, it is to take out [.41 Derringer](/card/01688) and [Flashlight](/card/01087) that is out of uses. (They are much harder to discard from play area than you think.) When 20 cards runs out, you will want both in the discard pile instead of stuck on you. \"Fast\" also make it action efficient to do so.\r\n\r\nNote! Per the rules, if [The Black Fan](/card/08057) isn't on your other hand yet and you have 1 free hand, you cannot voluntarily play [Switchblade](/card/01044) onto the hand with dead gun/flashlight. It must go to the free hand. (But finding the fan should not be too difficult given the deck size.)\r\n\r\nIf you have the Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion, try slot in the upgraded version!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) \r\n\r\nYour 3 investigations of happiness will come again soon once the deck reshuffles! This card is so good it is never replaced. [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) is perhaps worth replacing more than this card but I would keep both.\r\n\r\nMake sure to use up the battery and try bumping it out with [Switchblade](/card/01044) or [.41 Derringer](/card/01688) before the deck runs out.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Scout Ahead**</span>](/card/08047) \r\n\r\nThe main attraction of this card is <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icon rather than its effects.\r\n\r\nI say this card became great in thin deck because it allows you to have 2x [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) under constraint of [Underworld Support](/card/08046). The <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> is useful for [Sneak Attack](/card/01052), evade setup for [Backstab](/card/01051), and gambling. Thinking this way, [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) is pretty offensive! It is never removed because of this reason.\r\n\r\nIn rare case, you maybe able to use the 3x move. Keep in mind that if you do so while engaged, you take 1 Attack of Opportunity, not 3. (Due to one \"Move action\" in bold.)",

      "description_md": "\"Mahou Shoujo\" means \"magical girl\", a Japanese story genre where a girl with seemingly normal life can transform to another self, often with changed appearance and a signature weapon. This deck is named so because there is a certain pink-haired magical girl that uses a [bow](/card/08118) as her signature weapon. Now you can make a contract (pay health) and pretend to be one with just an EotE expansion! (And print her [parallel front](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2020/12/3/bad-blood/).)\r\n\r\nThe highlight of this deck is spamming [Blinding Light](/card/01066) and while you are disengaged, reposition yourself to shoot the [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) at range. [Blinding Light](/card/01066) should be recycled with her \"blood magic\" ability so it starts coming again more and more often as your deck thins out.\r\n\r\nThis deck uses **only the front side** of Parallel Agnes, therefore retaining her <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> access to various health sponges. Side quest includes using [Divination](/card/08101) to trigger [Scavenging](/card/01073) while the enemy is blinded to recover [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018), which is now a soak asset for use with \"blood magic\", among other tanking stuff such as [Leather Coat](/card/01072) and [Holy Rosary](/card/01059).\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ❄ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/arkham-horror-card-game-edge-earth-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP.

(A magical arrow comes back on the next turn, it does not come with an arrow quiver...)\r\n- Close range fighting is unlimited, the bow's charge is only required for ranged attacks.\r\n- Always 2 damages, and starts at absurd accuracy of 6 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for Agnes.\r\n- Refill the ranged charges with [Winds of Power](/card/08063), which is possible to get via [Parallel Fates](/card/08066).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blinding Light**</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\"><span class=\"card-xp\">••</span></span>\r\n\r\n- The filler when you need to repeatedly attack an enemy. If succeed, grants you an another turn that the bow is ready once again. You may or may not walk away after doing this. \r\n- Dealing damage as the same time as evading is very powerful. It ensures you can drag out the fight without damage and make progress to end the fight in the same test, where regular evasion you would also need to attack it somehow.\r\n- Evade also grants AoO free moment, which you may use to investigate with [Divination](/card/08101) while waiting for the next turn or just move away, or use [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) for an extra cool impression that you disappeared after the light faded out.\r\n- Keep using \"blood magic\" if possible, until your deck really thins down, which at that moment you are likely fighting the big guy with annoying minions you really want to blind them.\r\n- Even the upgraded version is stinky and not giving you any <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> bonus. In mid-campaign, we will get [Prophetic](/card/08120) to improve the chance.\r\n\r\n# In the Thick of It XP\r\n\r\nChoose to take 2 physical trauma (makes it riskier to use blood magic often) to get these nice cards right from the start with your 3 XP from [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) : \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**2x Divination**</span>](/card/08101) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nWaiting to receive [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) discount without taking purchase penalty. Also make you more functional from scenario 1, as you can trigger [Scavenging](/card/01073) with it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Mind Wipe**</span>](/card/01568) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThis is a card you sometimes glad you have it at a certain \"moment\". By keep using \"blood magic\", you have more chance of having it on that \"moment\" rather than having to hog it on hand.\r\n\r\n# Blood magic\r\n\r\nAgnes's parallel front ability is to play **Spell Event** (Does not work on Spell Asset like [Divination](/card/08101)) at -2 cost and taking it back to deck, at the cost of 1 damage. Here are all the options : \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blinding Light**</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThe \"flash bang\", your never ending offensive + defensive tool. Highly recommended to recurse, it usually translates to surviving longer when the deck really thins down.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Ethereal Slip**</span>](/card/08110) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nPosition yourself for shooting the bow, save your team by breaking engagement from far away. Upgraded version is also good as <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> commit, which when you do so, you cannot recycle.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) \r\n\r\nThis card is already very valuable, and now you have an unlimited amount of it! However, it costs 1 horror which parallel front Agnes not having much of. (Try using the matching 2x [Fearless](/card/01067) to heal out the cost.) If you get one again while having no spare sanity, <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon can still be useful.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Mind Wipe**</span>](/card/01568) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nUtility card that feels just right having it at 1 copy.  Normally you may think whether to use it or wait for more dangerous non-Elite enemy to show up. Now you can just use it with \"blood magic\" then expect it to come back again later.\r\n\r\n## Blood magic techs\r\n\r\n- 0 XP [Blinding Light](/card/01066) and 0 XP [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) are at 2-cost, (discounted to 1 on their upgrades). The ability can help playing them at 0 cost.\r\n- When your deck is low, the \"concentration\" of cards gets higher and it is more likely that you will see the Spell you just recycled. This can feel like you can control the fate somewhat with cards like [Blinding Light](/card/01066) (avoid taking hits turns after turns until you win that big final fight) or [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) (avoid unexpected mess while fighting the big guy).\r\n  - Therefore, the value of Spell recursion gradually increases if you managed to recur it from when your deck is fuller, until the deck gets very thin, which may cost you multiple health. Choose wisely which one you want to see at later moment.\r\n- In a REAL pinch when you get [Advanced Dark Memory](/card/90019) with not enough resources (4) to play and you cannot also take any more horror, you play with recursion (it is a Spell Event) to discount it to 2, add doom, take 1 damage, and shuffle it back to the deck having to see it again. Does not sounds great, but can be better than helplessly defeated.\r\n- You will love having [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) around when recycling spells so you can fetch that spell back on hand fast especially when the deck is thin. But be careful of getting only [Dark Memory](/card/90019) as a valid target among 3 cards, which you must draw it.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\nHere are the [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) compatible upgrades in recommended order, max 2 discounted upgrades per scenario. In actual play you would have to decide these based on XP you got each scenario. \r\n\r\n**Remember that** you have to slot in [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) **purchase** (as opposed to upgrade) among these ASAP so you have something better than [Shrivelling](/card/01060) to fight with, and that costs 3 XP each. (2 + 1)\r\n\r\nDon't feel bad if after paying for the bow you cannot get to 2 upgrades quota, the bow is more important.\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination</span>](/card/08101) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination</span>](/card/08103) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Ethereal Slip</span>](/card/08108) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Ethereal Slip</span>](/card/08110) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">5 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01580) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01584) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">6 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination</span>](/card/08101) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual small\">Divination</span>](/card/08103) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">8 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01580) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01584) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">9 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01588) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01693) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">10 XP</span>|\r\n<span class=\"small\">[(View at arkham-starter.com)](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/upgrade?i=ChQSBTAxNTY2GgUwMTU2OSABMAE4AQoUEgUwMTU2NhoFMDE1NjkgATABOAIKFBIFMDgxMDEaBTA4MTAzIAEwAjgEChQSBTA4MTA4GgUwODExMCABMAE4BQoUEgUwMTU4MBoFMDE1ODQgATABOAYKFBIFMDgxMDEaBTA4MTAzIAEwAjgIChQSBTAxNTgwGgUwMTU4NCABMAE4CQoUEgUwMTU4OBoFMDE2OTMgATABOAoSRBoCWFAqBwoD4oaSEAEyDQoEQ29zdBIFVG90YWw6BggBEAEYAVABWhwoVmlldyBhdCBhcmtoYW0tc3RhcnRlci5jb20pGhgKBAgBEAMSBBIAGgAaCggBEAEgASgBMAEiB3A6MzcxMzE%3D)</span>\r\n[//]: # (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nAnd here's the purchases which you must pay 1 more for each.

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n# Some tactical tips\r\n\r\nDelay getting hit by a Hunter enemy by using [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) on nearby location, then move once away. The next turn when it closes in, you can do this again as long as you still have charges left on your bow. While doing this, perhaps investigate because you are not engaged yet.\r\n\r\nUpgraded [Ethereal Slip (2)](/card/08110) is flexible on a map with enemy scattered. Possibly some of them are Hunter, some of them are not, that cause this situation. You can now \"juke\" the Hunter monster by targeting this spell on a non-Hunter enemy repeatedly to get the required breather room to gear up or perform ranged attack using [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118).\r\n\r\nIntentionally stay further from helpless investigator such as a Seeker. When the Seeker draws an enemy, use [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) to swap with an enemy currently engaged with the Seeker to both let the Seeker continue doing the job, and also teleports you to the same location, getting ready to engage and fight when it walks back. Use ranged attack when it is one location away as it walks back, and tell your Guardian to close into it is also a pretty cool combo.\r\n\r\n# Advanced signature yes or no? (yes)\r\n\r\nUsing [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) will add soaks, which the 3 sanity is especially reassuring for her parallel front's low sanity. Limitation is that damages and horrors must come from player card. \r\n\r\nThe downside is you have to use [Advanced Dark Memory](/card/90019), which is worse than regular one because the cost is increased from 2 to 4, and also you still take 2 horrors if you cannot play it. Remember that she has 6 sanity on her parallel front, this could be critical!\r\n\r\nA silver lining is that [Prophetic](/card/08120)'s resources can be used to discount playing [Advanced Dark Memory](/card/90019).\r\n\r\nI highly recommended using the Advanced version. Because [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) being soak asset rather than pure utility asset naturally set it up with [Scavenging](/card/01073) triggered with [Divination](/card/08101) to revive it and continue soaking / using spell recycling ability.\r\n\r\nThe key to remember is that it cannot just tank everything like normal asset, but only from **player cards**. But not to worry, we have quite plenty of these : \r\n\r\n## Player card damages\r\n\r\n- Agnes's [\"blood magic\" ability](/card/90017).\r\n\r\n## Player card horrors\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Shrivelling</span>](/card/01560)  : Replaced with 2x [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Ward of Protection</span>](/card/01565) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) •• : The 0 XP version does not have horror taking.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Dark Memory</span>](/card/01013)\r\n\r\n# Taking damages\r\n\r\nThe cost to recycle [Blinding Light](/card/01066) and [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) is taking damage, along with regular damage you take from enemies and treacheries.\r\n\r\nThese are cards that helps you use this ability as often as possible :\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Heirloom of Hyperborea</span>](/card/90018) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Leather Coat</span>](/card/01572) \r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Scavenging</span>](/card/01573)  : Get back everything above.\r\n\r\nNone of these helps with horror. \r\n\r\n# Taking horror\r\n\r\nThis parallel front Agnes has only 6 sanity. And Survivor does not have many horror soaks in our card pool.\r\n\r\nHorror from your cards can be assigned to [Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) and recur using [Scavenging](/card/01073).\r\n\r\nWe won't get [Relic Hunter](/card/01695), therefore [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) is in slot contest with [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018). You should use use the sanity on [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) liberally as well if you know [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) is coming soon. Or inversely, the draw effect from [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/90018) would help you get [Holy Rosary](/card/01059).\r\n\r\n[Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) has a very good 2 sanity at play cost of only 1. Use these sanity liberally to both kill her quick enough before doom is used to advance the agenda. Remember that [Ward of Protection](/card/01065)'s horror cost can also be assigned to [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063).\r\n\r\nLastly, trusty 2x [Fearless](/card/01067) gives you virtually +2 sanity most of the time.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Parallel Fates**</span>](/card/08066) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\n- An obvious combo is to find [Winds of Power](/card/08063) among your 6 cards and put it on top, then you draw it, and use <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to play it, and possibly discount playing with [Prophetic](/card/08120) (because of Spirit trait).\r\n- If you have [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063), you can arrange Spell to be at 2nd, 3rd, and 4th card (the 1st card you will draw immediately after), then use <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> to grab it. Maybe critical to get [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) down fast before the bad guys came. (Downside is that the remaining cards will be shuffled away after, making you unsure about the future again.)\r\n- After you have just recycled some spells, especially when the deck is getting thinner, playing [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) afterwards may immediately see that spell and allow you to arrange it if you need it back quick. (e.g. [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) over and over.)\r\n- It can be used as a search card for your teammates looking for game-changing signature card with not many search tools because it says \"an investigator's deck\". You don't have to be at the same location with that investigator.\r\n- By looking at encounter deck playing 2 players, 6 cards means you can arrange your fate for as far as 3 turns. That is a lot, and can save your teammates (especially <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>) from <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests.\r\n- Commit icons are similar to [Guts](/card/01089).\r\n- In EotE campaign, without spoiling anything, you may came across **many** useful stuff that you can make use of knowing what is on the top, or several top cards of your deck.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Winds of Power**</span>](/card/08063) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\n- The <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> draw \"during your turn\" occurs due to the following :\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Parallel Fates</span>](/card/08066) ••\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Heirloom of Hyperborea</span>](/card/90018) \r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Guts</span>](/card/01589) \r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Manual Dexterity</span>](/card/01592)\r\n  - You use Draw action.\r\n- [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) **cannot** get this card since it is a Spirit, not a Spell.\r\n- Commit icons are similar to [Guts](/card/01089).\r\n- Can be discounted by [Prophetic](/card/08120) due to Spirit trait.\r\n- Can refill [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) and [Divination](/card/08101).\r\n- Also look for your campaign story assets with \"charges\". Usually these are powerful.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Prophetic**</span>](/card/08120) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\n**Discount playing**\r\n\r\n| 　 |  | | 　Cost　|  |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|:-:|:-:|\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566)　| Spell Event | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) ••　| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Ethereal Slip</span>](/card/08108) 　| Spell Event |  2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Ethereal Slip</span>](/card/08110) ••　| Spell Event |  1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Mind Wipe</span>](/card/01568) •　| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Ward of Protection</span>](/card/01565) 　| Spell Event | 1 |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Dark Memory</span>](/card/90019) 　| Spell Event | 4 |\r\n| 　 |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Shrivelling</span>](/card/01560) 　| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination</span>](/card/08103) ••••　| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Enchanted Bow</span>](/card/08118) ••　| Spell Asset | 3 |\r\n| 　 |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Winds of Power</span>](/card/08063) •　| Spirit | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">\"Look what I found!\"</span>](/card/01579) 　| Fortune | 2 |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Lucky!</span>](/card/01580) 　| Fortune | 2 |\r\n| 　 |  |  |  |  |\r\n\r\nDiscount Spell Event when **not** using \"blood magic\", since that also gives -2 discount.\r\n\r\n**Helps boosting tests**\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Enchanted Bow</span>](/card/08118) ••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination</span>](/card/08101) •\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Divination</span>](/card/08103) ••••\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) ••\r\n\r\nYou can both discount and boost accuracy of [Blinding Light](/card/01066), but generally you want +2 accuracy since even the 2 XP version is stinky and not giving you any bonus. When taking high damage/horror is on the line, you will not want to miss [Blinding Light](/card/01066) on 3-4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy! (Your 6 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> due to [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) probably need 1 or 2 more push.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Lucky!**</span>](/card/01584) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>, [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01693) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThese 2 XP upgrades aren't popular, but with \"blood magic\" card draw is spicy as it either get you the spell you just put back in the deck or thin down the deck so it is more concentrated for more recycling.\r\n\r\nAlso, these are great with [Down the Rabbit Hole](/card/08059) since the lv. 0 version can all wait in the starting deck.\r\n\r\nNot having resources to play [Dark Memory](/card/90019) is an \"emergency\", sometimes this [Emergency Cache](/card/01693) can really help.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Scavenging**</span>](/card/01573) \r\n\r\nRemember these lifeline cards you must bring back with [Divination](/card/08103), especially that you took trauma from [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) :\r\n\r\n| 　 | | 　Health　 | 　Sanity　 |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:-:|\r\n|  | 1x [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Advanced Heirloom of Hyperborea</span>](/card/90018) 　| 3 | 3 |\r\n|  | 1x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">Holy Rosary</span>](/card/01559) 　| 0 |  2  |\r\n|  | 2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Leather Coat</span>](/card/01572) 　| 2 | 0 |\r\n| 　 |  |  |  |\r\n\r\n([Holy Rosary](/card/01059) reduced to 1 copy along the upgrades.)",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n✷ By putting down [Crafty](/card/08123), holding [Sledgehammer](/card/08094), and having [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116), you can achieve 5 class icons for [Cheat the System](/card/08050) and [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077). That's why they are immediately purchased right after. [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) is an excellent card that make you feel like superman for a test. Somehow this kid could do it all!\r\n\r\n❂ Wendy's 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is **not** enough for vanilla investigate on 2 shroud 3<span class=\"icon-per_investigator\"></span> clues location. [Lockpicks](/card/01687) kind of overkill those locations too. If you don't have any better clue getters in your party, consider purchasing this earlier. (Perhaps in place of the 2nd copy of [Crafty](/card/08123), for the same price.)\r\n\r\n✧ 1x of lower version [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) is left in the deck. In the end, you will have 1x of each version, for both fight flexibility and cost saving.\r\n\r\n✰In my run, though [Scavenging](/card/01073) possibility is tempting, I found its 4 play cost a bit too much when [Cheat the System](/card/08050) is not quite working. Look at your campaign whether the latter half seems to have a lot of Hazard treachery or not in deciding whether to get this, or skip it.\r\n\r\nGuts removal can be changed to Overpower if you want, look at your party's balance. Overpower is retained here so Wendy leaned towards hitting the hammer more.\r\n\r\nYou suffer no Exile consequence when using [Burn After Reading](/card/08076) in the final scenario, because you won't continue playing after that. Highly recommended if you have a spare 1 XP towards the final scenario.\r\n\r\nLastly, the not-so-exciting [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584) (Not in the side deck) is also an option. Drawing bonus is cool on Wendy since maintaining several cards on hand means more chances of chaos token redo.\r\n\r\n# Making use of the off-stat\r\n\r\n[Sledgehammer](/card/08094)'s main attraction is the \"quality swing\" which may cost more actions (and losing out to some other weapons attacking multiple times) but is accurate and hits hard.\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this deck is getting her 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to be over 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, through mainly **temporary** boosts. [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) has special synergy with this style of fighting and especially with low combat character, since it \"compresses test\" to fewer times letting you virtually do more for your one-time boosts.\r\n\r\nConsidering we are making a character with 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> works, where previously it looks like the game is telling you to use other stats to do the job. It means the other high stats are still there to play with. This Wendy do really well against the unknown! Be it blind run, true solo play, or slot into any party that need different kind of help.\r\n\r\n# Turning temporary boosts to reliability\r\n\r\nThe glue that connect [Sledgehammer](/card/08094), [Lockpicks](/card/01687), and [Flashlight](/card/01087) together is [Crafty](/card/08123). A replenishing source of temporary boost.\r\n\r\nIt improves \"Tool\" trait playing discount as well as efficiency on their <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> ability. Hammer starts hitting things, and \"[Crafty](/card/08123) investigation\" will help with [Scavenging](/card/01073) as well. We purchase as many as 2x [Crafty](/card/08123) in this deck to highlight this play style.\r\n\r\nThe usual \"offensive Tactic event\" for Wendy such as [Backstab](/card/01051) and [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) are not in this deck at all, giving unusual flavor of playing her than her Revised Core Set deck.\r\n\r\n[Jury-Rig](/card/08074) is a nice 0 cost Event compatible with the amulet, to improve hammer's accuracy to respectable range. Early scenarios will need some pumps from [Hard Knocks](/card/01049), later on [Crafty](/card/08123) can support your hammer swings.\r\n\r\nTwo starting events [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) and [Ethereal Slip](/card/08108) can be discounted by [Crafty](/card/08123) while playing with the amulet. Nearing the end of campaign, we add a bit more of these fun Insight/Trick Event such as [Fend Off](/card/08082) and [Burn After Reading](/card/08076).\r\n\r\n# Challenges\r\n\r\nThe main challenge is to deal with 2-handedness of [Sledgehammer](/card/08094), which prevents equipping [Flashlight](/card/01087) or [Lockpicks](/card/01687) at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Scavenging](/card/01073)  and [Professor William Webb](/card/08104) can help get the hammer back after an intermittent clue works are over, but also [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) is always around the corner to make your discard pile gone.\r\n\r\nA constant bumping in and out of these Tools is also important for bringing used up [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) to the discard pile for further rigging via the amulet should it comes later.\r\n\r\n# Campaign tips\r\n\r\n## 1st scenario\r\n\r\nShe will not win fight with <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> without [Crafty](/card/08123). At this stage, finding [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) and [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) is critical!\r\n\r\nPay a bit more and you will see 3 HP enemy explode, which is also an HP number most investigator don't want to deal with. Payment can be obtained with using Resource action with help from [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). Do not afraid to use Resource action a lot instead of your 4th action, since Leo is great for anything test-less.\r\n\r\nTo beat a big enemy solo in the first scenario without Event + amulet play, try rigging the hammer with [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) and have [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) ready. Performing <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> gets you 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, try boosting it to 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> each time with 1x rig + 1 resource [Hard Knocks](/card/01049). The final action, try Evade and hope you can do it again the next turn.\r\n\r\n## 2nd-3rd scenario\r\n\r\nWith [Crafty](/card/08123) Wendy is able to finally do meaningful things a few times per turn. With [Lockpicks](/card/01687), she can now survive longer with [Scavenging](/card/01073). Remember to use [Crafty](/card/08123) with [Flashlight](/card/01087) as well to improve [Scavenging](/card/01073) chance.\r\n\r\nKeep your horror in check as [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) is your only horror defense, and it could be triggered only at the final blow. The only other horror soak is [Professor William Webb](/card/08104). For health, we have [Leather Coat](/card/01072) and [Bandages](/card/08073).\r\n\r\nTry make use of the useful Synergy cards : [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) and [Cheat the System](/card/08050). With [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) + [Talisman of Protection](/card/08116) + [Crafty](/card/08123), you have all class icons.\r\n\r\n## Towards the end\r\n\r\nFinally we move on to higher [Sledgehammer](/card/08096). We still retain the lower level hammer as well, sometimes <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> is just right.\r\n\r\nThe higher version can also be thrown for commit for a whopping <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, and of course get back with [Scavenging](/card/01073) or [Professor William Webb](/card/08104). (And hope that [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) is not coming when it is out of hand.)\r\n\r\nWhen story ask you to add optional story asset to your deck, remember that it also reduce consistency of the deck as well if you accept too many new cards. At some point, you may stop seeing the [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) or [Crafty](/card/08123) together for an entire scenario!\r\n\r\n# How to use [Sledgehammer](/card/08094)\r\n\r\nNormally, Wendy is an \"Event fighter\". That is quite costly and bursty, depends on discard pile as well as [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), as well as if [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) ruined your plan or not.\r\n\r\nThe \"high fight\" option (<span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span>) will lose out compared with regular fighter attacking multiple times with a +1 damage weapon. However, table is turned with Wendy because she has only 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. A weapon like [Fire Extinguisher](/card/08080) that is otherwise great on other Survivor will do nothing without accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe hammer and especially [Sledgehammer (4)](/card/08096) version gives her sufficiently accurate hit with [Crafty](/card/08123) and [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) to get out of sticky, Event-less situation, when playing solo.\r\n\r\nWith [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), it opens up a variety of new combo such as move it and whack, or whack and evade and move out, etc. Where previously you lack actions to do so given the clunky nature of the hammer.\r\n\r\nIn the end you would have 1x of each version. Sometimes it is useful to keep using <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> on the **smaller hammer** for action efficiency, then throw the bigger hammer from hand for <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> icons. (And try [Scavenging](/card/01073) the bigger hammer back for more commits.) Double hammers attack!\r\n\r\n# Mastering [Jury-Rig](/card/08074)\r\n\r\nThe 2x of this card is the key of hitting your [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) swing. We have to master **every** aspect of it!\r\n\r\nIt is an Event. (At first glance it may looks like an asset!) Therefore, [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) can play it from discard pile. Nice thing about this is that it is 0 cost! Usual Wendy is broke from playing all the events, this one is quite agile to play.\r\n\r\n## Getting it to the discard pile\r\n\r\nThe next mission is how to get the rig to the discard pile once the durability worn out. Note that the card does **not** say it is going to discard automatically (unlike e.g. [Bandages](/card/08073)).\r\n\r\nTherefore it is important to try bumping an entire hammer out with [Flashlight](/card/01087) or [Lockpicks](/card/01687) to take out the rig altogether, once you feel that the battle settled down. This is the reason this deck keeps 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) and adds 1 more [Lockpicks](/card/01687) to improve the chance of \"tearing down\" the rig.\r\n\r\n## Rigging non-hammer items\r\n\r\nLastly, you can also rig [Flashlight](/card/01087) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) if you want. For [Lockpicks](/card/01687), it has a clause that discard itself once supplies runs out, making it useful to take the rig to discard pile.\r\n\r\nOne rule to note is that you cannot intentionally discard [Flashlight](/card/01087) by playing [Lockpicks](/card/01687) while you still have free hand available. Therefore, look for [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) to bump out rigged [Flashlight](/card/01087). (This is when you love it being 2-handed!)\r\n\r\n## Multiple <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> triggers\r\n\r\nIt is easy to miss that <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> can be triggered multiple times, potentially getting you +4 or +6 for your skill test (!). This is the same rule as pump cards like [Hard Knocks](/card/01049).\r\n\r\nWhen you only found [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) but not others such as [Crafty](/card/08123), [Hard Knocks](/card/01049), [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077), or [Overpower](/card/01091), sometimes you may have to go for multiple durabilities in **very important swing**, such as last-shotting a boss which missing it results in boss not dying and 2/2 you, or turning your friend engaging with the boss to pulp.\r\n\r\nAnd often the rig came when you had already used some supplies out of your [Flashlight](/card/01087) or [Lockpicks](/card/01687). Using multiple durabilities can make it go out of use at the same time.\r\n\r\n## Errata\r\n\r\n[Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) had [received errata](https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/16/73/16736473-35f6-42e7-ac32-60811326865f/ahc_faq_v19_1.pdf) in the v1.9 : This card’s Forced ability should read: \"Forced – After you play an event **or discard an event from play**:…\" \r\n\r\n[Jury-Rig](/card/08074) is an Event that **attaches instead of going to the discard pile**. Original [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014)'s Forced ability cannot trigger on it at the moment you play. Unfortunately, with the corrected text, the rig goes back to the deck after you managed to bump it out. (\"discard from play\")\r\n\r\n**Errata is not a taboo** (it is a print correction), you should follow it instead of choosing whether to follow it or not.\r\n\r\n# [Crafty](/card/08123)\r\n\r\nThis card holds the deck together and is also the name of this deck. Try to get it on your mulligan hand!\r\n\r\nIncidentally both [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) mentioned both have \"Tool\" trait! This card fits perfectly to boost <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> / <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span> accuracy, or ensuring that [Lockpicks](/card/01687) lasts long.\r\n\r\n[Flashlight](/card/01087) is also a Tool, which is never removed from this deck to act as a semi-Lockpicks to trigger [Scavenging](/card/01073). [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) can add more to the investigation chance.\r\n\r\nPlaying these Tool can also be discounted as well. Both [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) are now 1, and [Flashlight](/card/01087) is free to put down.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, when using [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), this card can help paying Insight and Trick cards that are Event. This deck does not include her usual Tactic events such as [Backstab](/card/01051) and [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) for this reason.\r\n\r\nFinding the 2nd copy can be put down so you are even more efficient at everything (4 discounts/boosts to allocate!), or commit it for nice <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> in a pinch.\r\n\r\n# Other items to scavenge\r\n\r\nOther than [Sledgehammer](/card/08094), [Lockpicks](/card/01687), and [Flashlight](/card/01087), you should use [Scavenging](/card/01073)/[Professor William Webb](/card/08104) for :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Talisman of Protection</span>](/card/08116) : Prevents dying. (Even from [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) direct horrors!!) Despite being \"talisman\", it is an Arcane and not clashing with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014). This also ensure you have <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> class for Synergy.\r\n  \r\n  Also remember you can equip to teammates. In my run with Roland, he often get the talisman at the start of the game and it is always helpful given his 5 sanity + some [Cover Up](/card/01007) trauma! Mid scenario where it finally breaks, you can scavenge back for personal use.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Leather Coat</span>](/card/01572), <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Protective Gear</span>](/card/08095) •• : Prevents dying. [Protective Gear](/card/08095) also gives <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> class for Synergy, when your hand slot is on the \"[Lockpicks](/card/01687) phase\" instead of \"[Sledgehammer](/card/08094) phase\", as well as soaking more horrors.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Bandages</span>](/card/08073) : Also prevents dying (lol).\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">Wendy's Amulet</span>](/card/01014) : Notice that it has very good <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icons. If you have [Scavenging](/card/01073) or [Professor William Webb](/card/08104), you may as well commit it as [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) when discard pile is currently not looking great.\r\n\r\n# How to use [Professor William Webb](/card/08104)\r\n\r\n- Take note of low shroud location and use it to drain clues from nearby harder locations. (Note that this is way better than [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097), since that one uses the target location's shroud.) You can Investigate low shroud location that is already out of clues in order to trigger his ability (to find \"hidden connections\").\r\n- It is a [Scavenging](/card/01073) that does not require +2 over-succeed. It can be clutch if you don't have access to easy shroud location or is lacking commits or [Lockpicks](/card/01687) to get things back in time.\r\n- If you have [Scavenging](/card/01073) down, you can even get 2 Item from one Investigate action! Try putting Webb down when many soaks are used up ([Leather Coat](/card/01072), [Protective Gear](/card/08095), [Bandages](/card/08073)) to ensure the most digging target other than [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) before Leo arrives.\r\n- This deck does not include [Charisma](/card/01694), so plan to use up his 3 charges liberally and make him die so you can replace with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), your life-long friend.\r\n\r\n# Dealing with [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015)\r\n\r\nThis card encourages not hogging tons of Events in the discard pile for [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) play, otherwise you risk losing all your precious memories! The same goes for Items that are waiting for [Scavenging](/card/01073) trigger. By using [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014)'s often, you sent some of them goes hiding in the deck safe from this weakness.\r\n\r\n- 2 direct horrors : \r\n  - <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Talisman of Protection</span>](/card/08116) : It is ideal to prevent sudden defeat. But remember that it needs to be a killing blow that you can activate the talisman. The 2nd copy can be given to <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> teammate, such as [Roland Banks](/card/01001).\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Plucky</span>](/card/08081) ••• : Direct horror will pass through this card. Sometimes that is a blessing since you want to keep your permanent stat boost going.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Jury-Rig</span>](/card/08074) : This event card attaches to your Item instead of going to discard pile even when out of use, effectively \"avoid\" being removed from the game from this weakness for some lucky turns.\r\n\r\n# Other tips\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Fend Off</span>](/card/08082) •••, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">Ethereal Slip</span>](/card/08110) ••, <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Scout Ahead</span>](/card/08047) : These [Crafty](/card/08123)-compatible events has good <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icons! Making it more likely to ended up in discard pile for amulet play. Note that [Fend Off](/card/08082) replaces [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) in the upgrade, retaining commit icon balance.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">Cheat the System</span>](/card/08050) • : It maybe easy to miss that this is also an Event that amulet could use. Use it to obtain funding to play more events from the discard pile or play expensive card such as [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) or [Protective Gear](/card/08095). Try playing it vanilla before putting down the amulet to get rich fast. It also \"opens up\" the discard pile so that the thing under it is effectively the \"top\" of discard pile, due to its 0 play cost and Fast keyword. \r\n\r\n  When hogging it in discard pile waiting for more class Synergy, beware of [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) at the end of round removing it. You have your final <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window at the beginning of Upkeep Phase before you ready stuff and draw.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">Burn After Reading</span>](/card/08076) • : If you want to go for \"level 2\" burning to slow down doom (the lowest cost to repurchase), this deck got : [Ethereal Slip (2)](/card/08110), [Protective Gear](/card/08095), and [Professor William Webb (2)](/card/08106). Anyways, burning level 0 card is also good on insane location. Remember that this card itself exiles, and so you cannot use amulet to play a 2nd time. Try committing its <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon before playing from discard pile with amulet.",

Remembered that feeling when you opened the core box wanting to make [Shotgun](/card/01029) work with [Roland Banks](/card/01001) but couldn't? It lacked consistency provided by [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) that came with Dunwich Investigator Expansion.\r\n\r\n[Shotgun](/card/01029) is a power weapon with ammo / hand slot issue requiring some support. This deck offers **2 paths of tutoring** the sub-weapon  :\r\n\r\n- Using <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards on her 5 splash slots, [Shrivelling](/card/01060) can get into the vacant Arcane slot, searched up with [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063), which also tanks good amount of horror. Zoey needs it.\r\n- Using [Bandolier](/card/02147) to additionally equip [Machete](/card/01020) or [Knife](/card/01086). 2x [Knife](/card/01086) are not removed at any point on upgrade, for theme. (look at her portrait) These 4x melee assets improve the hit rate of [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) so it hit something even if not a [Shotgun](/card/01029), it make sure taking time to play [Bandolier](/card/02147) is not wasteful.\r\n\r\nEconomy to prepare the [Shotgun](/card/01029) or pump [Physical Training](/card/01017) for [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) is partly provided by Zoey's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability, and we add 2x [Stand Together](/card/02148) to the mix. [Bandolier](/card/02147)'s 2 resources are hard to swallow otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis deck is almost a pure fighter except when [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) hits the 1x [Rite of Seeking](/card/02028) once in a blue moon that god says she should investigate this night for a change.

I expecting 20-24 XP to be an average of your blind run, so that's why the [Moment of Respite](/card/02273) + [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) part looks like that. [Moment of Respite](/card/02273) needs to be able to come in at least 1x when your cumulative failed [Smite the Wicked](/card/02007) reach an annoying point.\r\n\r\nThe position of [Shotgun](/card/01029)'s inclusion so soon is also assuming you are playing Dunwich. Any more late, you missed too much chance to blast the mid-campaign baddies.\r\n\r\nThe Extra section is just in case you take her to other campaigns with higher XP output. (Perhaps you buy only Campaign Expansion going forward.) Otherwise, feel free to not take out the [Monster Slayer (5)](/card/02300) from your collection to the Side Deck. This XP expensive card is not critical to the deck at all, but is on the theme with Zoey. (She goes out to slay monsters at night.)\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : The Dunwich Legacy** series is now complete with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Shotgun & Magic](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40696)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Snipe the Wicked](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39059)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Misfortune Foresight](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40697)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Simple Dark Horse Rex Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40318)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Basic Quad-Boost Jenny Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42576)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : News of Isabelle](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39057)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Jim Culver: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Aureolus-Axe](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41463)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> \"Ashcan\" Pete: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Persistent Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39056)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Flare Spam Roland Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42578)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Higher Willpower](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40317)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Adaptable / Typewriter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41464)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Average Dunwich Agnes Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41826)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : 1 Combat Against All Odds](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40435)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps.

It requires over-success to hit the highest potential, so +2 is very welcomed. Add some more from [Physical Training](/card/01017) to make it count.\r\n\r\nHandy in a messy fight that you are trying to preserve [Shotgun](/card/01029)'s ammo to have a [Knife](/card/01086) hidden in your [Bandolier](/card/02147). [Machete](/card/01020) only adds +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and is weak on multiple engagements.\r\n\r\nThough I love the [Knife](/card/01086), keeping also 2x [Machete](/card/01020) around is good to improve [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) hit rate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Moment of Respite**</span>](/card/02273) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThis card came in later scenarios expecting that you had failed [Smite the Wicked](/card/02007) for a bit. It also retains the same <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> commit icons of [Guts](/card/01089).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Taunt**</span>](/card/02017) \r\n\r\nCan be useful even with 1 enemy to engage so you don't blow your friend's head off with the [Shotgun](/card/01029).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Shrivelling**</span>](/card/01560) \r\n\r\nThe 1 horror rebound can be an issue if you failed [Smite the Wicked](/card/02007) too many times. [\"If it bleeds...\"](/card/02225) and 2x [Moment of Respite](/card/02273) that came in at the end can alleviate this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Physical Training**</span>](/card/01517) \r\n\r\nYou may have heard that this kind of card is \"deprecated\". I don't agree, and it is not because this is a low pack count deck that I am forced to use this card. I **want** to use this card.\r\n\r\nThe perfect pump Talent for this deck's combination, you can pump for [Shotgun](/card/01029)'s over-damage, or pump for [Shrivelling](/card/01060) hit to substitute the lack of [Holy Rosary](/card/01059), or pump to make [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) deals +2 damages.\r\n\r\nIf you are playing Dunwich campaign, you will thank the +<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> that it can do, too!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Stand Together**</span>](/card/02148) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThe art may make you think of using this while you are fighting off hoard of enemies together, but you do get hit with AoO if engaged just by trying to \"stand together\". Perhaps play while you are free of engagement before using [Taunt](/card/02017) to start fighting.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Rite of Seeking**</span>](/card/02028) \r\n\r\nThough only 1x copy, this is by far my favorite card in this deck. Not often we have a Guardian that can use Mystic card, and has 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to not be that bothered by the 0 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost. [Physical Training](/card/01017) can even pump for more. Picking 2 clues as a Guardian feels great! Try helping out on 2 shroud locations.\r\n\r\nYou may try 1x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) instead to add 2x of this card, if you are confident in [Bandolier](/card/02147) + [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) to get a sidearm for [Shotgun](/card/01029).",

[Machete](/card/01020) is also not in the Taboo list anymore.)**\r\n\r\nIt may seems counterintuitive that Zoey would want to use a card [Springfield M1903](/card/02226) that cannot be used when you are engaged. The 5 splash cards tell the full story of this deck.\r\n\r\nBoth [Elusive](/card/01050) and [Stray Cat](/card/01076) can provide the disengagement. Use this chance to fire the Taboo [Springfield M1903](/card/02226), or blast them down with [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024). If they are not dead, then you might be able to make engagement play again with [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006).\r\n\r\n[Springfield M1903](/card/02226) is also often overshadowed by a shinier [Lightning Gun](/card/02301) in the same pack, so I would like to make a deck to play with this sniper rifle.\r\n\r\n[Bandolier](/card/02147) let her use [Machete](/card/01020) while holding [Springfield M1903](/card/02226), waiting for the right moment.\r\n\r\nTo take advantage of the rifle, this deck is better at higher player count. She cannot disengage outside of her splash cards to shoot. She can shoot immediately if the enemy spawns on the other members in the first place.

I wish I could add one more of this. The 1 damage allows finishing off 4 HP enemy with the [Springfield M1903](/card/02226) as a combo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Stray Cat**</span>](/card/01576) \r\n\r\nCheap evade that you just need to pre-equip. Contest in slot with [Beat Cop](/card/01018), so you should use it liberally.\r\n\r\nYou can evade enemy that is engaged with your teammate as well. Then in Upkeep Phase where it would ready, you can take the engagement and grab the resource.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Elusive**</span>](/card/01550) \r\n\r\nZoey loves engaging with a lot of enemies for resources but not when she can't finish em off fast enough. This card can help fixing a lot of trouble at no action, and to make [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) / [Springfield M1903](/card/02226) plays.\r\n\r\n# HP Management\r\n\r\nThis deck let you play a game of looking at enemy's HP, as you have [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006), [Beat Cop](/card/01018), [Vicious Blow](/card/01025), [Machete](/card/01020), [Springfield M1903](/card/02226), ... that deals different damages from 1 to around 3-4.\r\n\r\n[Zoey's Cross](/card/02006) and [Beat Cop](/card/01018) can be triggered after Hunter enemy moves into you but before it attacks, so you can make some play with something that was left with 1 HP.\r\n\r\n[Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) and [Springfield M1903](/card/02226) deals 3 damages, and therefore good to bring 4 HP enemy to 1 HP.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Springfield M1903**</span>](/card/02226) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nAgain, this is using [Springfield M1903](/card/02226) with taboo which can shoot up to 1 location away.\r\n\r\n- [Elusive](/card/01050) is an obvious card to make cool plays with this gun as you get to move to nearby location.\r\n- [Blinding Light](/card/01066) / [Stray Cat](/card/01076) allows her to evade without using <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, and then you can shoot it on the same location.\r\n- [Stray Cat](/card/01076) being <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> is great as you can potentially dump all 3 ammo to the same enemy with all your actions fully.\r\n- Other than evading to exhaust and break engagement, you can also shoot an enemy that your teammate is engaging. (At your location, or a nearby location.) Have your teammate go first and take engagement away could be a great way to shoot without losing the splash toys. Fight action will not provoke attack of opportunity even if you are currently busy with your own enemies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Emergency Aid**</span>](/card/02105) \r\n\r\nThis card is mainly for healing [Beat Cop](/card/01018). It can also heal you after you use [Smoking Pipe](/card/02116) a lot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Zoey's Cross**</span>](/card/02006) \r\n\r\nWhen using [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006), remember that it exhausts and costs a resources. The resource cost offset with Zoey's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability. Therefore if you choose not to damage the enemy, you get +1 resource. You may decide to not use the cross if your weapon can finish it easily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Teamwork**</span>](/card/02018) \r\n\r\nGuns, [Beat Cop](/card/01018), and [Bandolier](/card/02147) and the one hand weapon to go with it costs considerably to setup. You may ask for resources to speed up the setup.\r\n\r\nAlso you can share [Stray Cat](/card/01076) away if you need to put down [Beat Cop](/card/01018) right now.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Taunt**</span>](/card/02019) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nDespite looking like a card for Zoey, in my play-testing I think 1 copy is enough. It is a shame the 2XP version also does not give double icons, otherwise I would use 2 copies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Stand Together**</span>](/card/02148) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\n This is used when you are grouping up trying to attract enemies to make [Taunt](/card/02017) plays. Double will icons are pretty good too.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Bandolier**</span>](/card/02147) \r\n\r\nIt is painful to play this card at 2 resources and then you also pay 3 for [Machete](/card/01020). But because Zoey cannot evade without special cards, it is quite important to have something other than [Springfield M1903](/card/02226). Bite the bullet and put it down.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/01525), <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/02299) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nFine tune enemy's HP so it is at the right value to finish off with [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006) or [Beat Cop](/card/01018).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"I've had worse…\"**</span>](/card/02261) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nOnly included as an extra upgrade if you play this deck in high XP campaign. (Unlikely to get in Dunwich!) With this, you can safely fight 2/2 enemy across turns.\r\n\r\nAnd look at these icons! Double <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> makes Zoey get through <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery much easier. Note that [Guts](/card/01089) are never removed as well. With this joining the deck, 6 sanity will be protected for long time. (Especially if you have missed some [Smite the Wicked](/card/02007) quests.)",

([\"player order\"](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#In_Player_Order)) This deck's [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) + [Think on Your Feet](/card/02025) tech works its fullest if Rex know he is going to draw the enemy he just saw. So try to be the lead as much as possible.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Magnifying Glass**</span>](/card/01540) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nThe pick up ability can be used when you are playing with 2x [Magnifying Glass](/card/01540) but suddenly [Old Book of Lore (3)](/card/01686) came and you want to temporarily switch to it until its 2 secrets are all used up.\\\r\n\r\nSometimes you need <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boost on non-Investigate test. In that case you can pick it up and commit away for +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> if passing means a lot to you.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Deciphered Reality**</span>](/card/02303) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••••</span>\r\n\r\nDon't forget the regular 1 clue picking of this **Investigate** action, before you pick 1 each from each location including the current location. (So you get 2 minimum from the current location.)\r\n\r\nAlso Rex's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> can even pick up 1 more.\r\n\r\nThis card's cost makes it hard to play in addition to its effect, but luckily he can use that <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icon just fine to get his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability going every round.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Old Book of Lore**</span>](/card/01686) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nRex wants to use his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> once each round. So he is also indirectly incentivized to distribute his workload, waiting for the next round to investigate for 2 clues again. (Especially if there are exactly 2 clues left.) This sort of card make good use of his remaining actions.\r\n\r\nYou can tutor yourself (pick up some useful Skill cards like [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227)), or tutor your friends for anything. If someone played Rogue with Exceptional card, getting that 1x copy out may decide the victory of scenario.\r\n\r\nYou can use [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> to peek at any investigator's top card to aid the decision to use <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> for this. Rex is not [Daisy Walker](/card/01002), reading book isn't free!\r\n\r\nIt is still infinitely usable like the 0 XP version, even when out of secrets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Inquiring Mind**</span>](/card/02227) \r\n\r\nThis card can get oversuccess for Rex's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> even on 4 shroud (put down [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) and [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) too).\r\n\r\nBut the real power of this card is to commit for others. There is no \"commit only to test you perform\" on this card. Combined with game rule that let you commit only 1 card to someone else, this card can get unlikely stats to the passing zone miraculously. (For example, getting [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003)'s 2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to pass [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) check.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**\"I've got a plan!\"**</span>](/card/02107) \r\n\r\nThis card will not see much use since you are busy moving and getting clues, and accuracy is not boosted by [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030). ([Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) is able to boost it.)\r\n\r\nBut I believe new players are eager to perform many tasks as opposed to only focus on the primary task. This card make you feel giddy holding it much more than the classic [Mind over Matter](/card/01036). I think they are worth keeping to the end, even if not very efficient. (We play games for fun!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Hyperawareness**</span>](/card/01534) \r\n\r\nBecause of Rex's over-success <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> mechanics, <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> pump is not bad. On average you would have 1x [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) and 1x [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) on you for 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. This value looks good, but only allows -1 to activate <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> bonus clue on 3 shroud. Throwing in 1 resource will improve the chance greatly on Standard, especially when the special symbols are equivalent to -2.\r\n\r\n[Deciphered Reality](/card/02303) is expensive to play, but if you have spare resources, it would love some pumps as it has very high reward.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> pump is **also** good for Rex's 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to get a comfortable Evade against 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Think on Your Feet**</span>](/card/02025) \r\n\r\nIf you are going to move to the next location but you are out of action for this round, you are risking your plan to be ruined by enemy spawn in Mythos Phase, normally you would be hindered down and you choose how to resolve it among your teammates.\r\n\r\nWith this card, not only you prevents that, you also gain extra \"tempo\" because you move to where you are going to anyway. You are not just moving to survive. (Watch this to understand tempo : [HOW TO WIN ARKHAM HORROR: THE CARD GAME | Understanding Tempo\r\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeFdlHUpDJ4))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**\"I'm outta here!\"**</span>](/card/02151) \r\n\r\nVP location are often optional and out of the main path, and have you worry if you should just safely pass the scenario using Resign option. With this card, you can really go out there to grab extra Victory Point and just fly home if it turns out you can't make it in time due to bad token draws.\r\n\r\nOf course only works in Resign scenario, but at least it also has <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> which Rex can use to get to 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.\r\n\r\nGame rule states that you must drop all your clues when performing Resign, the same as when you are defeated. (So it is bad if you are defeated on a VP location that had been cleaned up.) With this card, you must also drop all your clues, but you can do it on any location you like. There is a \"bug\" in Dunwich's The House Always Wins scenario related to this rule, and this card can fix the bug. Please try to figure it out on your own what I am talking about!",

A Seeker deck without [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033).\r\n\r\nUse [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) as a way to spend your Upkeep resource to 0 to activate [Dark Horse](/card/02234). If you trickle around 1 and 0 resources, then you can either 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Evade or 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> once a turn. (You also have 2x [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) to help boosting further, the upgraded version has no play cost.)\r\n\r\n[Pickpocketing](/card/01046) and [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) are card draw counter of [Rex's Curse](/card/02009) that keeps coming back taking away your Upkeep draws. This deck has about 10 skill cards, drawing likely makes you better at future tests.\r\n\r\n[Seeking Answers](/card/02023) and [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) are also 1 cost card great with [Dark Horse](/card/02234). We also make use of [Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685) upgrade in your Revised Core Set purchase. Rex's ability goes well with this card.\r\n\r\n[Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302) again costs just 1 and also can play with Rex's ability when you put down a clue. You can picks 2 up together the next time or try [Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685) to pick it back together with clues all around. Dropping a clue also enables [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227).\r\n\r\nThe premium card in this deck is [Cryptic Research](/card/01043). It can support your team's fighter to setup. Unlike high XP assets, 2x purchase (8 XP) of this fast and 0 cost Event will likely be played and see results as soon as you draws into them while not breaking your [Dark Horse](/card/02234) plan.\r\n\r\nYou can pair this deck with other decks that wants to take a shot at 2x [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) in the off-class slots.

We have 2x Unidentified [Strange Solution](/card/02021) in the deck, yet it upgrades to 4 XP one on only 1 copy.\r\n\r\nThis plan is with Dunwich campaign in mind which gives low XP. If we want both 2x [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) and 2x [Deduction (2)](/card/02150) ASAP before the campaign ends, we would have to hog useless 2x Unidentified [Strange Solution](/card/02021) in the deck for too long (essentially a <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> commit after you done the identification) and even worse if you arrive at scenario 7-8 at only ~20 ish XP.\r\n\r\nBetter to have 2x Unidentified to help identifying easier, turn one to something useful earlier, then turn the other copy into 4 XP upgrade for the finale. Therefore this plan expects you to finish identifying by 14 XP, and continue hogging 1x Unidentified version until 22 XP point. (You cannot remove both even though you recorded in the campaign log already, Researched rule states that it must be included by **upgrading**.)\r\n\r\nIf you finish identifying it way earlier than 14 XP (e.g. by 10 XP point) and want to be an alchemist earlier, you can swap the \"[Guts](/card/01089) -> [Cryptic Research](/card/01043)\" plan for the solution upgrade one, getting rid of 2x Unidentified version completely earlier. (And having 1 less [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) to play with.)\r\n\r\nBut at least, 2x [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01040) and 2x [Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685) are must-have due to synergy with [Dark Horse](/card/02234) and Rex's ability, before messing with the solution.\r\n\r\nI believe [Higher Education](/card/02187) is not a priority upgrade in this deck when we have [Hyperawareness](/card/01034), and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> is awesome with Rex. If you are playing **without** Taboo, then feel free to move [Higher Education](/card/02187) earlier. At 6 XP it actually encourage me to keep using [Hyperawareness](/card/01034).\r\n\r\n## Which Strange Solution?\r\n\r\nI have included 2 variants of the solution in the Side Deck. Your decision can change until you reach the upgrade point mid-campaign at 14 XP.\r\n\r\n- [Strange Solution: Acidic Ichor](/card/02263) : 2022 Taboo decrease the damage to just +1, making it work like cheap costed accurate gun. Still good for this deck, and it gets a boost from [Dark Horse](/card/02234).\r\n- [Strange Solution: Restorative Concoction](/card/02262) is a good choice if you took more physical trauma than expected, or your party is full of low health investigators. Compared to Acidic Ichor, it also has 4 supplies instead of 3. You can take this upgrade before 2x [Deduction (2)](/card/02150) if situation is dire.\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : The Dunwich Legacy** series is now complete with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Shotgun & Magic](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40696)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Snipe the Wicked](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39059)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Misfortune Foresight](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40697)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Simple Dark Horse Rex Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40318)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Basic Quad-Boost Jenny Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42576)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : News of Isabelle](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39057)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Jim Culver: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Aureolus-Axe](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41463)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> \"Ashcan\" Pete: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Persistent Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39056)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Flare Spam Roland Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42578)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Higher Willpower](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40317)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Adaptable / Typewriter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41464)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Average Dunwich Agnes Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41826)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : 1 Combat Against All Odds](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40435)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQwNjk2EAEKCQoFMzkwNTkQAQoJCgU0MDY5NxABCgkKBTQwMzE4EAEKCQoFNDI1NzYQAQoJCgUzOTA1NxABCgkKBTQxNDYzEAEKCQoFMzkwNTYQAQoJCgU0MjU3OBABCgkKBTQwMzE3EAEKCQoFNDE0NjQQAQoJCgU0MTgyNhABCgkKBTQwNDM1EAE%3D)\r\n\r\n# Mulligan\r\n\r\nYou start with 5 resources and that is kinda anti-[Dark Horse](/card/02234) thing to have. This deck have easy to remember Asset that costs more, great to drain out your starting resources in preparation. Try getting these at start.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Dark Horse**</span>](/card/02234) (Cost 3) : The main thing of this deck.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Pickpocketing**</span>](/card/01546) (Cost 2) : Can draw more and finally get you [Dark Horse](/card/02234) / [Hyperawareness](/card/01034).\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Hyperawareness**</span>](/card/01534)  (Cost 2) : Can drain resources.\r\n\r\nWith 2x copies each, they are hard to completely miss on mulligan. If you use 5 resources to put both [Dark Horse](/card/02234) and [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) on the first turn (possibly also the 0 cost [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01540)), you are setup to counter <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> tests in the upcoming Mythos, or evade the spawning enemy better.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Dark Horse**</span>](/card/02234) \r\n\r\nPairing this with [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) is the path to victory / survival. Because at the very least, you can perform one Evade at 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> minimum to fix enemy spawn, though that left you forever poor.\r\n\r\nWhen you don't have [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) yet, you may need the \"no resource\" option in anticipation to perform <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> at both 4. (Perhaps a scenario location test, or just try not getting a treachery hit.)\r\n\r\nIn Upkeep Phase, game rule states that you **draw before gaining resource**. You can see the card first before deciding whether to take the resource or not. If you are at 0 resource and see 1 cost card ([Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685), [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075), [Strange Solution](/card/02021), [Mind over Matter](/card/01036), [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302)) you may decide to take a resource to play it back to 0 resource.\r\n\r\nUse various draw cards [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075), [Pickpocketing](/card/01046), [Cryptic Research](/card/01043), [Search for the Truth](/card/02008) to get to [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) if you got bad starting draws.\r\n\r\nIf you got caught with a <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test while having 1+ resources, [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> can drain resources to 0 to get [Dark Horse](/card/02234) activation to 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> still, even if the icons aren't matching. (Matching icon is the rule of committing cards.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Shortcut**</span>](/card/02022) \r\n\r\nYou can use it on yourself to do tricks with [Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685) to expand the clue discovering range, or finding easier location to succeed.\r\n\r\nYou can see this card as extending the range of <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> Resign location. Since Resign will not cause AoO, together with this card as Fast, you pretty much ensure your safety regardless of enemy spawning when trying to work on last few things before you bail out near the Resign location.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Rabbit's Foot**</span>](/card/01575) \r\n\r\nMakes you a bit happier when [Rex's Curse](/card/02009) cause you to fail. This card is not Fortune!\r\n\r\nNote that a fixed [Rex's Curse](/card/02009) keeps coming back and likes to void your Upkeep draw. Taking a bit of time to equip this is the counter for the lack of draws more than you think. (I know it is tempting to throw it for <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Dr. William T. Maleson**</span>](/card/02302) \r\n\r\nIt is easy to forget how tanky this guy is for just 1 resource. 2 healths are very valuable. Watch he dies to <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> test instead of you, and then you can use that 1 resource you got to [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) +<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> instead of +<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.\r\n\r\nSometimes dropping clue on easy location maintains tempo really well if you are going to [Seeking Answers (2)](/card/01685) on it. Succeed by 2 or more, discover all 2 from connecting locations, and discover 1 you just dropped using Rex's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Mind over Matter**</span>](/card/01536) \r\n\r\nYou can use [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) to boost <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> further. This card at least allow Rex to punch 2 HP enemy to freedom without having to keep evading it.\r\n\r\nWhen fighting with <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, remember that you don't get bonus from [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01540)\r\n\r\nThe thing about 1 resource round with [Dark Horse](/card/02234) + [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) vs. [Dark Horse](/card/02234) + [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) is that [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) gets you 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> once, but [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) gets you 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> three times in a row. Sometimes you really need to evade repeatedly to move away from 2 enemies, or wait for the fighter on hoards of enemies. And so, we not dare removing any [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) for his health safety.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Cryptic Research**</span>](/card/01543) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nThe priority is to make someone that can kill enemies in the team get their tools of the trade. If they already have some, use on yourself to assemble [Dark Horse](/card/02234) + [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) + [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302) safety combo.\r\n\r\nIn emergency, try counting the discard pile and determine if the \"miracle cards\" are both out, 1x out, or not yet. (Depending on what kind of emergency, it might be [Mind over Matter](/card/01036), [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227), [Deduction (2)](/card/02150), ...) This card is Fast, and can essentially \"summon\" a certain card out with a little help from probability calculation.\r\n\r\nPlay only during your turn means it is not usable when inside a Mythos Phase test. Better to play one to get some cards earlier if you feel like you are lacking commits for Mythos defense.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Seeking Answers**</span>](/card/01685) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThis is a crazy card. It normally replace the regular 1 clue of the Investigate action with the 2 flexible clues (there is an errata that add \"instead of\", see more inside the card page), but with Rex's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability it is like you add back the regular 1 clue at your location, now you can get up to 3 clues at once. (Still not counting potential [Deduction](/card/01039).) [Magnifying Glass](/card/01040) is of course usable in this.",

Remember you can skip all AoO while doing so. It also helps you get to [Izzie](/card/02011) faster, saving action for that <span class=\"icon-action\"></span><span class=\"icon-action\"></span>.\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dynamite Blast**</span>](/card/01524) : There are all sorts of play you can make with [Shortcut](/card/02022) and [Cat Burglar](/card/01055).\r\n\r\n# How to play (simple!)\r\n\r\n- [Streetwise](/card/02189) is a very important [Backstab](/card/01051) enabler. (So basically you pay 5 resources to try 3 damage, not so absurd for Jenny.) They are not so useful before you get 6 XP for [Streetwise](/card/02189).\r\n- [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) would come later to let you [Backstab](/card/01051) + [Streetwise](/card/02189) at 7 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, which can win -3 token vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. This number allows adding [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) for insurance against -4. If you don't get -4, then you would get the extra action.\r\n- Use [Streetwise](/card/02189) to beat [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011) on difficult location.\r\n- [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) is the key card to make [Switchblade (2)](/card/02152) an unlimited killing machine. (Especially vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, to get that 2-over.) Otherwise you have to rely on [Overpower](/card/01091) or [Physical Training](/card/01017). Use [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) to make the most use of hiring cost before sending them to die somewhere.\r\n- At the point of adding [Charisma](/card/01694), we have 4 non-unique (<span class=\"icon-unique\"></span>) Ally in the deck. This allow stacking the same Ally too, making sure whatever you get you can put down.\r\n- [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) usually is a bit hard to use due to its 2 cost. I think they are good fit for Jenny's resources that can make her pass all kind of tests.\r\n- [Lone Wolf](/card/02188) is still useful despite Jenny's ability. You will need a lot of resources to use [Streetwise](/card/02189), [Backstab](/card/01051), [Cat Burglar](/card/01055), and [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024). (Or her [Jenny's Twin .45s](/card/02010).)\r\n- [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) can support [Switchblade (2)](/card/01252) if you want to ensure the 2 damage to finish off an enemy. If you start at 2 over the difficulty only <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> is the problem. If you are 1 over the difficulty, only 0 makes you hit for 1 damage. Good idea to add [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) in this test as the 2-over criteria is the same.\r\n- Sometimes the scenario need you to Resign at the goal, yet [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011) spawns wayyy back when you are so close to the goal. This is when [\"I'm outta here!\"](/card/02151) gets serious. I believe that 1 copy is going to be awesome when it mattered. Otherwise, commit <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for [Backstab](/card/01051).\r\n- This is not going to happen often, but if you are going to Resign with [\"I'm outta here!\"](/card/02151), you can use [Shortcut](/card/02022) to drag enemies away from your team before bailing out, skipping all AoO. This may buy some setup time for your friends while it Hunter back to the party. (It must not be Massive.)\r\n\r\n# Lucky Dice Tips\r\n\r\n[Lucky Dice](/card/02230) does not say \"exhaust\", as long as you have 2 more resources you can keep revealing the next one. (Without putting the previous one back to the bag.) Doing so would increase the risk of hitting <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>, however. But it is still a good use of Jenny's resources.\r\n\r\nThe deck retains all 8 basic skill cards, to go with all-boosting theme of this deck. In the latter half of the campaign, try using their success-draw effect to get to [Lucky Dice](/card/02230) which is Exceptional, so only 1 copy allowed in the deck.\r\n\r\nAt the end of upgrade you will have 2x [Sure Gamble](/card/01056), which can sometimes combo with [Lucky Dice](/card/02230) (thematically matched, awesome!) to try passing hopeless test, a test that you intentionally go in at skill value **below** the difficulty and hope for the flipped negative to win. You can use [Lucky Dice](/card/02230) until you see high enough minus that you can flip into the required value. \r\n\r\nEach 2 resources equals [Lucky Dice](/card/02230), [Streetwise](/card/02189), or [Sure Gamble](/card/01056). Conveniently Jenny gets you 2 resources each round. Think carefully when using them in combination. [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) is powerful but the other 2 options are reusable.",

[Leo De Luca](/card/01048) provide a spare action to use <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> on [Cat Burglar](/card/01055), or for replaying [Flashlight](/card/01087) while on the move, so enemies don't catch up with you while you go drain a new location.\r\n- You may have a mountain of resources after stabilizing with 2-3 allies. Don't go overboard in spending [Hard Knocks](/card/01049), remember that allies can die and you need to replay them.\r\n-  Maintain [Newspaper](/card/02155) and [Flashlight](/card/01087) on hand. [Jenny's Twin .45s](/card/02010) takes backstage in this deck, you can just commit it away for +3<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> [Backstab](/card/01051).\r\n- Get away from any spawning enemy with [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) and continue working wherever she ended up at instead of killing it. Recommended to left odd clues here and there so you can work immediately after moving around. You can do this to arrive at [Izzie](/card/02011) quicker by surfing the enemies.\r\n- Hands-free attack events [Backstab](/card/01051) and [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) so you don't have to hold any weapon. Work on clues diligently to ensure she has resources to play their expensive 2~3 cost. [Cat Burglar](/card/01055)'s boost is needed for both.\r\n- Use exceptional <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> cards to accelerates your investigation and clutch out a scenario.\r\n- [Scavenging](/card/01073) can bring back drained [Flashlight](/card/01087). Knock out an empty [Flashlight](/card/01087) to discard pile with Fast-play [Switchblade](/card/02152), if you got no treachery that cause the discard.\r\n- Overall feels like a greener, female [Monterey Jack](/card/08007).\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\nDepending on if your party has a dedicated fighter or not, decide whether to get the exceptional cards ([Ace in the Hole](/card/02266) + [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305)) first, or the [Switchblade (2)](/card/02152) + [Opportunist (2)](/card/02231) set first. This matters a lot for Dunwich campaign, which you may only reach about 20 XP on your first play without a <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> pumping [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111).\r\n\r\n[//]: #

(Also you will be taking all physical copies of them.)\r\n\r\n# The 5 splashes\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Newspaper**</span>](/card/02155) \r\n\r\nA card that define this deck together with [Flashlight](/card/01087) and [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). You can run around and grab clues flexibly at various shroud requirement, while able to fend off threats with one-off events or [Cat Burglar](/card/01055).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Dr. Milan Christopher**</span>](/card/01533) \r\n\r\nThe only possible permanent <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boost for Jenny in this card pool that is not taking the hand, and not [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232). Jenny needs a nudge from her 3/3/3/3 to be what you want to do. We dedicate her splashes for him.\r\n\r\nGenerates resources for playing attack events and the other 2 allies [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) and [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). (Total to 10 resources !!)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Scavenging**</span>](/card/01573) \r\n\r\nThis card makes her a great [Flashlight](/card/01087) user since she can bring it back. You just need to knock it out to discard pile, which is the task of [Switchblade](/card/02152) while an another hand is holding [Newspaper](/card/02155).\r\n\r\nYou may need to get your first clue with [Newspaper](/card/02155) on an easy location if you are going for [Scavenging](/card/01073) trigger 2 succeed-by. [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) cannot boost <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, there is no [Lockpicks](/card/01687), and this deck has no more XP allowances for tabooed [Streetwise](/card/02189).\r\n\r\nYou cannot bring back [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) since it is removed from the game.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Jenny's Twin .45s**</span>](/card/02010) \r\n\r\nNot recommended to equip or you may lose your investigation gadgets. Focus on using evasion and getting clues as much as you can until one of 2x [Backstab](/card/01051) / 2x [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) arrives if you want to dispose an enemy. Commit it for +3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>.\r\n\r\nEquip only when it is clear that scenario is transition to fighting phase.\r\n\r\nYou can play and choose X as 0 in order to discard an empty [Flashlight](/card/01087) in a hurry if you have no other way, when you want to [Scavenging](/card/01073) it back.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01588) \r\n\r\nDespite her innate ability, [Lone Wolf](/card/02188), and [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033), she still need some more money if allies to play came in close succession.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Lone Wolf**</span>](/card/02188) \r\n\r\nEncourages being away from the team, which [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) will make sure she could do so and coming back alive, and still not missing any turn without getting 1 more resource from [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033).\r\n\r\nIf you can fulfill [Lone Wolf](/card/02188) + [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) repeatedly, you are ready to use [Backstab](/card/01051) / [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) whenever you get them, along with having spare resources to replay the 2nd copy of the allies.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Quick Thinking**</span>](/card/02229) \r\n\r\nTry it together where you want to [Scavenging](/card/01073), perhaps [Flashlight](/card/01087) on 2 shroud location.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Cat Burglar**</span>](/card/01555) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nYou can equip 2 at the same time due to him not having <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> constraint, if you want. This makes you ready to do [Backstab](/card/01051) and [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) better.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Switchblade**</span>](/card/01544) \r\n\r\nThe laughing stock weapon has a task in this deck that is to play Fast (not costing action) to get [Flashlight](/card/01087) out of your hand for [Scavenging](/card/01073). The other hand needs to be occupied with [Newspaper](/card/02155), following the game's rule of discarding asset.\r\n\r\nJenny can sometimes pump into [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) to land that elusive +1 damage if really really needed to. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Switchblade**</span>](/card/02152) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span> <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span><span class=\"icon-tablet\"></span>\r\n\r\nIt gets real when upgraded. Not only you can still bump [Flashlight](/card/01087) out Fast, you have \"the serial killer\" combo you can pull off in a big fight due to its unlimited use.\r\n\r\nFind as many copies as [Opportunist (2)](/card/02231) as you can and repeatedly stab with both committed, perhaps with some [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) boost each time if you have the resources, to ensure they keeps coming back until the fighting is done. [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) action let you repeat this more, [Ace in the Hole](/card/02266) can get you 3 more, and [The Gold Pocket Watch](/card/02305) can get you even more. If multiple enemies exist, go from easier to harder so [Opportunist (2)](/card/02231) is not lost mid-way inside this combo.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Opportunist**</span>](/card/02231) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nAllows you to perform the [Switchblade](/card/02152) combo attacks.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Ace in the Hole**</span>](/card/02266) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span><span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>\r\n\r\nGeneral purpose card, you can pop it to drain a lot of clues or stab repeatedly with [Switchblade](/card/02152) + [Opportunist](/card/02231).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**The Gold Pocket Watch**</span>](/card/02305) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span><span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>\r\n\r\nWith [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) you get the action bonus again when repeating Investigation Phase.\r\n\r\n# Investigator combo\r\n\r\n- [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001) : When you draw an enemy, use [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) to disenegage and drop the enemy to her then she will get resources. This is better than Evade as exhausted enemy will not engage Zoey just yet.\r\n- [Teamwork](/card/02018) : Can take your spare resources or spare allies. Due to <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> constraint, you cannot play a new one while your ally is with the other investigator, except [Cat Burglar](/card/01055).",

You can put the horror on [Art Student](/card/02149).\r\n- Hope for [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269) to grant you \"critical hit\". This has many different paths you can choose.\r\n  - If you just spent to 0, taking 2 resources will make the +1 damage you hoped to get \"disappear\". You may take the draw instead to retain the +1 damage, or 2 resources if vs. enemy with 1 HP left.\r\n  - Or take 2 resources if you see that the symbol would cause you to fail.\r\n  - In the case of friendly fire, then you reduce the friendly hit damage if you take the 2 resources to cause the damage to disappear.\r\n  - If you have actions remaining, you can immediately use the 2 resources you just got to hit again at high +4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy. If you are pressed to land killing hit on high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy like 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with no resources currently, an unboosted 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> \"swing for symbol\" maybe the right play to get you more resources.\r\n  - Drawing is a natural way to get the signature [Jim's Trumpet](/card/02012) to add to the other hand.\r\n- Witching hour [Blood Pact](/card/07158). See below.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Blood Pact**</span>](/card/02191) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\n[Fire Axe](/card/02032)'s disadvantage is that in order to land the +1, you must boost it by spending from something resources to 0 resource. Without [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269) or [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) tricks you probably can swing that way once.\r\n\r\nNow at the round before Agenda advances, you can repeatedly swing at 0 resource relying on +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> here. This can potentially lands 4~6 damages! It being a Permanent makes this a reassuring combo.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Jewel of Aureolus**</span>](/card/02269) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nYou also get the <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> when other investigators at your location got the symbols.\r\n\r\nThis has synergy with \"at your location\" cards : [Jim's Trumpet](/card/02012), and [Hypnotic Gaze](/card/02153) as well. Try grouping up and fight on the same location.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Art Student**</span>](/card/02149) \r\n\r\nGood good card! Show the Seeker who is the boss when you take a clue out of VP location casually while gaining soaks. Worth Jim's splash slot!\r\n\r\nThe play with [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) is to get back 1 resource when 1/1 enemy is about to attack (Using <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window \"after Hunter enemy moves\", or in your turn if you are attacking with [Fire Axe](/card/02032) multiple times.), so [Art Student](/card/02149) dies exactly with all the assigned damage/horror.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Studies**</span>](/card/01562) \r\n\r\nThis card is kinda hot together with [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269). Just a gentle push to his <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and he can work on 2-3 shroud on Standard just like a Seeker!\r\n\r\nStay together with Seeker to farm resources from their investigation when they draws a symbol + [Jewel of Aureolus](/card/02269) <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>, and you can keep funding your studies!\r\n\r\nAlso without spoiling, both boosts are **very handy** in Dunwich campaign! (More than 1 scenario.) You will be glad this deck has 2x of this Talent never removed!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) \r\n\r\nI don't want to bet on [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) entirely, especially in the first few rounds with no enemies and you don't have enough resources to set everything up.\r\n\r\nIt is a good card to get on mulligan, since drawing can lead to setting up with other Asset, and you can work on clues.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Hypnotic Gaze**</span>](/card/02153) \r\n\r\n\"Bad\" card, but I know deep down you wanna play with this card sometimes. Ignore all the reasons and min-maxing tendency in you.\r\n\r\nVery specific tech is that if you pull an <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, you can use Jim's ability to treat it as <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> and perform the counter.\r\n\r\n[Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is of course handy to land the bounce damage. (Remember that <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> works to convert to <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> too.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Drawn to the Flame**</span>](/card/01564) \r\n\r\nTogether with [Art Student](/card/02149), Jim has a lot of ways to bypass high shroud or a location that says you can't investigate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) \r\n\r\nIt is easy to forgot Jim's <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> ability how it virtually increase the number of 0s in the bag. 0 or +1 vs. the test difficulty is actually not so hopeless with Jim. Try go at 4 shroud with [Flashlight](/card/01087) and be surprised.\r\n\r\nYou can also keep going at it with his bare 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> especially when you have [Jim's Trumpet](/card/02012), to try getting a <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> draw.",

\"Bonus\" section. This campaign is very stinky on XP.\r\n\r\nBut if you managed to get more XP, keep utilizing the exile effect of [Stroke of Luck](/card/02271) and repurchase it.\r\n\r\n(By the way, when I used this deck to clear Dunwich campaign on Standard (blind run with [Jim Culver](/card/02004)) I reached 27 XP.)\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : The Dunwich Legacy** series is now complete with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Shotgun & Magic](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40696)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Snipe the Wicked](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39059)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Misfortune Foresight](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40697)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Simple Dark Horse Rex Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40318)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Basic Quad-Boost Jenny Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42576)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : News of Isabelle](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39057)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Jim Culver: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Aureolus-Axe](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41463)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> \"Ashcan\" Pete: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Persistent Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39056)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Flare Spam Roland Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42578)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Higher Willpower](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40317)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Adaptable / Typewriter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41464)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Average Dunwich Agnes Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41826)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : 1 Combat Against All Odds](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40435)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQwNjk2EAEKCQoFMzkwNTkQAQoJCgU0MDY5NxABCgkKBTQwMzE4EAEKCQoFNDI1NzYQAQoJCgUzOTA1NxABCgkKBTQxNDYzEAEKCQoFMzkwNTYQAQoJCgU0MjU3OBABCgkKBTQwMzE3EAEKCQoFNDE0NjQQAQoJCgU0MTgyNhABCgkKBTQwNDM1EAE%3D)\r\n\r\n# The 5 splashes\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/01525) \r\n\r\nPitch in to [Duke](/card/02014) or other investigators. With [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) you can aggressively use it without overcommitting.\r\n\r\nIt makes a 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with 3 damages! Since he has Duke right from start, you have more chance of insta-killing annoying 3 HP enemy just by finding a [Vicious Blow](/card/01025). (And perhaps [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) to play with.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Deduction**</span>](/card/01539) \r\n\r\nPitch in to [Duke](/card/02014) or other investigators. With [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) you can aggressively use it without overcommitting.\r\n\r\nThe play with [Duke](/card/02014)'s ability is that you can move into a location with enemy and nab 2 clues with [Deduction](/card/01039), since the AoO check occurs at the location you were before. You may then use various evasion card if you can't finish it since [Duke](/card/02014) exhausted, especially if this play gets the location completely drained.\r\n\r\nHuman Pete can also go for [Deduction](/card/01039) play with [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) as a safety net vs. 2 (+1 advantage) or even 3 shroud (0 advantage), as these locations often has high amount of <span class=\"icon-per_investigator\"></span> clues. (Though it maybe better if you don't try again if it fails the first time, keep it for [Duke](/card/02014).) Vs. 4 shroud, you can additionally add [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192). [Newspaper](/card/02155) of course helps with everything.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n1x <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Liquid Courage**</span>](/card/02024) \r\n\r\nDrink up when you have to put horrors on yourself due to [Aquinnah](/card/01082) plays. He has 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to drink and +1 more if you reached the upgrade [Peter Sylvestre (2)](/card/02035).\r\n\r\n## Proxying the hot skills\r\n\r\n[Deduction](/card/01039) and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) are super hot cards from the core set, this deck let you see exactly why people win games with them.\r\n\r\nThat means if you have <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>, you maybe fighting for physical copies.\r\n\r\nIf they are in demand, I recommended you proxy them using the Lv.2 [Deduction](/card/01039) and Lv.2 [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) from the Dunwich box instead and pretend they are level 0 version. And then perhaps when your <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> wants to upgrade to Lv.2, just trade cards with them so you get the real Lv.0 version.\r\n\r\n# Other tips\r\n\r\nYou will soon notice interesting \"division of labor\" when you put down [Newspaper](/card/02155) and [Duke](/card/02014). If you have no clue, Pete can do 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> but Duke can do 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, but if you use [Duke](/card/02014) first then [Newspaper](/card/02155) will deactivate, leaving Pete at 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. So when facing 2~3 shroud, you may use Pete's 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> first, then Duke's 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> without the [Newspaper](/card/02155) effect. Try adding [Deduction](/card/01039) into the mix, and you have got fun quizzes to think about for every scenario.\r\n\r\nHis ability can ready [Duke](/card/02014) obviously, but also [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) in this deck, so he can try again, again. The other target is [Aquinnah](/card/02308), which allows you to perform some AoO suicide in Investigation Phase once, then ready using the next nearest <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window, and use her one more time in Enemy Phase. Or simply beg for AoO in Investigation Phase up to 2 times.\r\n\r\nAn important thing you get from [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033) is +1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to base 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, which allows him to Evade and exhaust-kick Hunter enemy away with [Bait and Switch](/card/02034), or sprint away with [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) (or together). This is what [Duke](/card/02014) can't do. Team up and help reducing damage that may lands on your good boy : )\r\n\r\n[Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033) + [Charisma](/card/01694) also soaks spill horrors when playing with [Aquinnah](/card/01082). Use [Liquid Courage](/card/02024) to heal horror if that is not enough.\r\n\r\n[Aquinnah (1)](/card/01582) is skipped in the upgrade, I tried her so I could use [A Chance Encounter](/card/02270) earlier, but she ended up being expensive horror shield mostly. [Leather Coat](/card/01072) is better. Go for Lv. 3 directly.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Survival Instinct**</span>](/card/01581), <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Survival Instinct**</span>](/card/02235) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nAfter [Duke](/card/02014) exhausted you will likely want to evade and have more turns of using [Duke](/card/02014). You can combine with [Duke](/card/02014)'s move in and investigate into a location with enemy, so you can drop the engagement and pass through the location.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Peter Sylvestre**</span>](/card/02033) \r\n\r\nTakes horror from using [Aquinnah](/card/01082), adds <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for evasion.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Peter Sylvestre**</span>](/card/02035) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nAdds <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for drinking [Liquid Courage](/card/02024) and avoid treacheries.\r\n\r\nHINT : Some enemies forces you to win with <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and not <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, you will be pleased to have starting 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Bait and Switch**</span>](/card/02034)\r\n\r\nWhen avoiding Hunter enemy, you will notice \"the race\" that if you don't move afterwards, it will engage back even though you avoid damage this turn. This card turns the action economy of Hunter fighting in your favor, so it lay exhausted elsewhere and readies at that location, not finding anyone. This means you have the next turn without a test blocking you, use 3 actions however you want.\r\n\r\nInversely, you can kick it to your teammate nearby so he can spend full 3 actions dealing with it instead of having to move. It also exhausts, so safe to go full offensive without worry about Enemy Phase damage or Retaliate.\r\n\r\nThe bad thing is that this card does not give any bonus and Pete's 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> is not enough. [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033) ups the chance of evasion, and you can use [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) together to move yourself also.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Newspaper**</span>](/card/02155) \r\n\r\nIf the location is not difficult, you can open by investigating on your own (4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>) to get the first clue, before transferring the work to [Duke](/card/02014) (4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>) once the [Newspaper](/card/02155) goes offline.\r\n\r\nIt is also compatible with [Duke](/card/02014) if the location is difficult and you have no clue, giving you 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. But [Duke](/card/02014) exhausts.\r\n\r\nYou can still use [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) in attempting 4 difficulty or more shroud since it looks at your base skill value not boosts from [Newspaper](/card/02155), giving you a reassuring 7 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Rise to the Occasion**</span>](/card/02192) \r\n\r\nWith 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, you can often try working off-[Duke](/card/02014) with 5 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. (Find a difficulty 4 test, doesn't work with 3.)\r\n\r\n[Try and Try Again](/card/02309) let you repeat this once more. It is great since 5 is just 1 more than 4, but the Standard difficulty's sweet spot is 2 more.\r\n\r\nThis card is also useful with [Deduction](/card/01039) and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to turn your human action to be even better than [Duke](/card/02014), which cannot use [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) due to a new base 4.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**A Chance Encounter**</span>](/card/02270) \r\n\r\nThis card gets committed for <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> more than an actual use.. but the use case is interesting I was tempted to keep 1x copy in the deck just in case.\r\n\r\nIt can get [Aquinnah](/card/01082) before moving into enemies, or get [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033) for some horror soak when you already have [Aquinnah](/card/01082) and don't want to use her sanity to take spill horrors.\r\n\r\nYou have limited time when bringing back [Aquinnah](/card/02308), so maybe it is time to use Pete's ready ability to AoO suicide twice, or once and tank Enemy Phase. Note that \"you still take horror dealt by the attack\" can be put on [Aquinnah](/card/02308), so in total she take 1 horror for the cost of ability and enemy's horror value. Normally you wouldn't so you can use her many times, taking only 1 horror per play. Now there is no need to preserve her sanity since [A Chance Encounter](/card/02270) expires at the end of round.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Aquinnah**</span>](/card/01582) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>, <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Aquinnah**</span>](/card/02308) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nNote that there is no <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window between each enemy's attack though you can arrange the attack as you wish. So you cannot use <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> ready inside barrage of attacks.\r\n\r\nThe way is try using [Aquinnah](/card/01082) once in Investigation Phase by taking action that cause AoO so it attacks you. Then ready and prepare her for one more time in Enemy Phase. Or use her twice in Investigation Phase with multiple AoO inducing actions. (Investigate, Play, Activate, ...)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Stroke of Luck**</span>](/card/02271) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nMay allow you to flex and pass critical end game scenario tests as needed. You can use the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon commit with [Try and Try Again](/card/02309).\r\n\r\nAn another nice thing is that the card it replaces, [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075), has the same <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon. But now it turns from Asset into a Skill Card, which is compatible with [Try and Try Again](/card/02309).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Lucky!**</span>](/card/01584) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>, [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/02194) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\n2 XP upgrade is not bad here, since card draw means he has more stuff to discard to use his <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> ability. Also with 10 skills in the deck, drawing likely gets you more things to play on the tests.\r\n\r\n[Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is needed to play [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02035) and [Aquinnah](/card/02308) in the same game quick enough, in the case that they came successively.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Unexpected Courage**</span>](/card/01593) \r\n\r\nThis is a premium card for [Try and Try Again](/card/02309), especially to help others. You will look like a selfless saint repeatedly bringing the stat that the investigator is expected to lose to equal the test in Mythos Phase, since there is no risk of losing the card for you... however there is a risk of exhausting [Try and Try Again](/card/02309) that you may want to use in your turn.",

If no XP to do so (you may decided to go further in the upgrade instead), replace the holes in your deck with <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Delve Too Deep**</span>](/card/02111)  (prepared in the Side Deck) and try to farm some more XP. That card is an Insight which Parallel Back can use.\r\n- At the end of upgrade you have these single copy :\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"If it bleeds...\"**</span>](/card/02225) : Recover from failed [Cover Up](/card/01007).\r\n  - [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Smoking Pipe**</span>](/card/02116) : Recover from failed [Cover Up](/card/01007).\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Teamwork**</span>](/card/02018) : Depending on your party, you maybe able to <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Flare**</span>](/card/02115) • from one investigator and transfer the Ally to others, allowing weird synergies.\r\n  - <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Elusive**</span>](/card/01550) : Fill in his weak 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> so he won't have to fight to death under some messy situations. (This card is thanks to Parallel Back's any class Tactic access.)\r\n- [Charisma](/card/01694) is :\r\n  - So you can use [Flare](/card/02115) even when you have [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528) already. You can hit either [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) or an another [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528). If you have [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) and hit an another [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) then the [Flare](/card/02115) miss as it has unique star (<span class=\"icon-unique\"></span>). (No exile, but wasted action and resources.)\r\n  - So you can [Flare](/card/02115) and get **other investigator's Ally** onto your field to combine with your own.\r\n  - So you can have fun with [Teamwork](/card/02018) and steal someone else's Ally, to combine with your own.\r\n- [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/02194) : This helps playing [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) normally or to share resources with [Teamwork](/card/02018).\r\n- Five weapon cards stay like that til the end of game. The \"upgrade\" comes in the form of 2x [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299). Stack 2x [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528) with [Charisma](/card/01694) if the enemy is really hard to land a hit.\r\n- You have 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> with [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) + [Police Badge](/card/01027). Even without [Guts](/card/01089) you have a chance to win 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests unscathed on Standard.\r\n- Many would be happy to get [Police Badge](/card/01027) via [Teamwork](/card/02018).\r\n- When you have [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) in the deck, you can attempt to summon enemies with this card in order to kill and get clues. Try grouping up with friends so you can shoot whatever spawned at anyone quick. Beware that [Machete](/card/01020) does not have that +1 damage when you are engaged with nothing, trying to attack what others got in delving deep. And it is good idea to have [Brother Xavier](/card/02106) before using this card as he can take punishments for anyone, as well as +<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for your own safety.\r\n\r\n# Advanced?\r\n\r\nSince this deck lacked XP for offense upgrades, it maybe tempting to switch to ADVANCED [Roland's .38 Special](/card/90030) (included for reference in the Side Deck) to improve his firepower. I recommended doing this for 3+ players where there are many players that can help you fix your ADVANCED [Cover Up](/card/90031) with 4 clues.",

We will improve concentration of [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) hits via XP we earned throughout the campaign.\r\n\r\nThis guide is with Taboo ON, which turns [Higher Education](/card/02187) from a no-brainer to a puzzle how can we cram other cards inside 20 XP to make the best use of 6 XP. Feel free to turn off Taboo if you want, but I want this deck to be compatible to both styles.\r\n\r\nThis plan is with Dunwich Campaign Standard in mind, which gives you low XP. Don't feel bad if you can't reach any [Old Book of Lore (3)](/card/01686) on your blind run!\r\n\r\n2x [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) are very strategic inclusion of this plan. The problem is [Higher Education](/card/02187) is the first upgrade, yet it is a chunk of 6 XP with Taboo on. The worst is that you gain 4-5 XP in the 1st scenario, and therefore cannot improve anything in the deck for the 2nd scenario. (Very possible if you venture into a certain gambling house.) [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) adds that extra push to let you reach 6 XP. If you still can't, it still ensure that by the 3rd scenario you get [Higher Education](/card/02187). They stay for the first half of the campaign.\r\n\r\n(If playing with Taboo OFF, feel free to remove all [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) and add 1x more [\"I've got a plan!\"](/card/02107) + [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) for better enemy handling. By the way, Taboo OFF [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) + [Higher Education](/card/02187) is already an OP combo.)\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : The Dunwich Legacy** series is now complete with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Shotgun & Magic](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40696)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Snipe the Wicked](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39059)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Misfortune Foresight](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40697)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Simple Dark Horse Rex Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40318)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Basic Quad-Boost Jenny Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42576)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : News of Isabelle](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39057)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Jim Culver: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Aureolus-Axe](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41463)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> \"Ashcan\" Pete: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Persistent Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39056)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Flare Spam Roland Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42578)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Higher Willpower](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40317)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Adaptable / Typewriter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41464)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Average Dunwich Agnes Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41826)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : 1 Combat Against All Odds](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40435)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQwNjk2EAEKCQoFMzkwNTkQAQoJCgU0MDY5NxABCgkKBTQwMzE4EAEKCQoFNDI1NzYQAQoJCgUzOTA1NxABCgkKBTQxNDYzEAEKCQoFMzkwNTYQAQoJCgU0MjU3OBABCgkKBTQwMzE3EAEKCQoFNDE0NjQQAQoJCgU0MTgyNhABCgkKBTQwNDM1EAE%3D)\r\n\r\n# Mystic cards\r\n\r\nMain theme of this deck is adding <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> / <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> support over the upgrades, since Dunwich box didn't give her any new Tome to play with. I think this is the way to make her as Dunwich-flavored as possible.\r\n\r\nMost of them is related to dealing with enemies instead of getting more clues. Therefore this Daisy keep her investigation power roughly the same as from the start.\r\n\r\nWe add 4 Spell cards that uses <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> without touching 2x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) that was there : 2x [Bind Monster](/card/02031) + 2x [Song of the Dead](/card/02112). Resulting in 6 Spell cards that [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can hit.\r\n\r\n# Hard compatibility\r\n\r\nNormally I made this series of 2 packs deck to be compatible with Standard only, which requires 4-6 stats to have fun, and 2-3 to have some chance. Hard-compatible deck will need some fun toys removed and add more no-nonsense stat boosters.\r\n\r\nIn this deck, due to stacked boosts from [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) + [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) + [Higher Education](/card/02187), this deck \"accidentally\" reach the point that pass tests on Hard difficulty on her main role even if I am not intended to. (Still, limited card pool with Hard will be HARD.)\r\n\r\nIf playing on Standard, you rarely need the +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> from [Higher Education](/card/02187) and instead using only +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> one. On Hard, [Higher Education](/card/02187)'s +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> became your daily routine to work on 3-4 shroud, and even need +4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to perform her secondary enemy management role. Good luck!\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Preposterous Sketches**</span>](/card/02186) \r\n\r\nA draw booster to get back to 5 cards that you can continue using [Higher Education](/card/02187).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Song of the Dead**</span>](/card/02112) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nShow off your experience from the Miskatonic Chorus Club. Mainly this just improve concentration of fight options for [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) search, though for expensive 2 XP cost each. But we don't have any alternatives to [Shrivelling](/card/01060) in this card pool.\r\n\r\nIt giving +1 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> is very welcomed in an off-class like this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Initiate**</span>](/card/01563) \r\n\r\nFull power comes when 4 more Spell cards are added in the upgrades, which also charges up your hand faster for [Higher Education](/card/02187)'s 5 cards requirement.\r\n\r\nYou can play [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) on top to clean up the doom, or use [Painkillers](/card/02117) to kill her. (lol)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Old Book of Lore**</span>](/card/01531) \r\n\r\nTry to get [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) which [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063)'s tutor effect does not cover. Also since she can use free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> for this, you can keep up with [Higher Education](/card/02187)'s 5 cards requirement easily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Fearless**</span>](/card/02268) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nPlay with [Painkillers](/card/02117) for more health heals / to support fixing [The Necronomicon](/card/01009). Use [Higher Education](/card/02187) to get to +2 over-success. If you just want to heal horror ASAP, you can get <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test from [Bind Monster](/card/02031) <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n\r\nNotice that these replaces [Preposterous Sketches](/card/02186), not touching any prior Skill cards. The reason is that :\r\n\r\n- 2x [Preposterous Sketches](/card/02186) were for drawing to 5 cards for [Higher Education](/card/02187), but after 4x Spell cards are added, I think [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can also fill this role if the search hit those spells.\r\n- Doing so improve Skill cards concentration to 10 / 30, should be good for deck with high draw power thanks to free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031). The more you draw, the more ready to use tools you have to pass tests.\r\n\r\nSpending XP for this instead of powerful [Deduction (2)](/card/02150) is also quite bold, but I think we should go all the way the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> route in this deck. You may disagree and use [Deduction (2)](/card/02150) instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Magnifying Glass**</span>](/card/01540) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nYou can <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> take it up to hand to temporarily satisfy the 5 cards [Higher Education](/card/02187) requirement, then Fast put them back down once you <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> paid the boost. This way they essentially reduce the cards requirement you must have on hand.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> take up to hand is sometimes useful when you are dual-wielding [Magnifying Glass](/card/01040) and you fear that [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) may suddenly comes to bump it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Shrivelling**</span>](/card/01560) \r\n\r\nWith Daisy you must remember that this card has no <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost. [Higher Education](/card/02187) turns this janky Lv. 0 spell into a reliable sidearm, like [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) in a hand of <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> investigator.\r\n\r\nBefore then (first 6 XP), you must also find [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) as a minimum requirement. Use [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) to do so.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Bind Monster**</span>](/card/02031) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThere is \"the play\" with [Higher Education](/card/02187) and [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033). After you managed to Evade the first time (must vs. monster's <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>), you can walk away and continue working to get funds from [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033).\r\n\r\nThen you can pay that fund to pump +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to [Higher Education](/card/02187) on the <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> (3) test. (This test is a static 3 difficulty, unrelated to monster's <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> value.) You can picture Milan dissecting the monster while you bind it still, for flavor.\r\n\r\nPlay cost of this card is very expensive. But it let you get away from low <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> monster spawn which tends to be a brute that hits for 2 health.",

      "description_md": "I want 1 deck in the Dunwich 2 Packs Deck Guide to utilize [Adaptable](/card/02110) meaningfully as an introduction to beginners how to use this card. [Adaptable](/card/02110) has 2 styles of use. First is to swap in level 0 card that synergised well only with your XP purchases, but not your starting decklist. Second is using your meta campaign knowledge of knowing the scenario and add in appropriate cards on campaign replays.\r\n\r\nThe first case we have [Bandolier](/card/02147) and [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) that aims to support the 2-handed [Chicago Typewriter](/card/02304) in the end. But when starting out, he is better off with [Beat Cop](/card/01018) to help the [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) get the over-success and [Bandolier](/card/02147) is initially useless. You can make such transition now with [Adaptable](/card/02110).\r\n\r\nThe second case he can switch between 3 scenario-situational cards [\"I'm outta here!\"](/card/02151), [Fine Clothes](/card/02272), and [\"If it bleeds...\"](/card/02225). I have prepared those to-be-adapted level 0 cards in the Side Deck.\r\n\r\nThis deck is a fighter. It also introduce you to more over-success cards than the Revised Core Set with [Opportunist (2)](/card/02231), [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299), and [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) joining from the Dunwich box.\r\n\r\n<span class=\"thumbnail small\">\r\n**► About \"2 Packs Deck Guide\"**<br>　A series of decks made with the new distribution model in mind, requiring a Revised Core Set box + **just 1 more** Investigator Expansion box. ⌂ character on the deck's name means the additional box it uses is [**The Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion**](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/products/dunwich-legacy-investigator-expansion/).<br>　It maximizes the chance of newcomers being able to build and learn to play the game, enjoying the story on Standard difficulty ASAP. They can then get into deck-building later if they wished to do so.

[Bandolier](/card/02147), but that's it for the investigation. [Lockpicks](/card/01687) aren't considered as I like the ability to drain out [Flashlight](/card/01087) supplies without exhaustion to make way for [Chicago Typewriter](/card/02304) when [Bandolier](/card/02147) can't be found.\r\n\r\nThis guide is with Dunwich campaign in mind, which gives you low XP. Extra section represent where you may not be able to reach on your blind run. If you do reach [Hot Streak](/card/01057), then [Chicago Typewriter](/card/02304) can be afforded much easier and he can also spend 2 to buy actions more.

Account for scenario where you swap in [Bandolier](/card/02147) as well as you would need 2 swaps quota there, try swapping in earlier scenario in that case. Some campaign has more than 1 answer, and you can mix up 1x of each card.\r\n\r\nFor example when playing Carcosa I would make this draft : 1. Resign, 2. Parley, 3. Resign, 4. Resign, 5. Monster, 6. Parley, 7. Monster, 8. Monster.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Opportunist**</span>](/card/02231) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThis card plays with 3 things having over-success cases : [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688), [Quick Thinking](/card/02229), and [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299). Add more <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> from [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) as necessary, if unavoidably vs. difficult tests.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> it adds as well. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Vicious Blow**</span>](/card/02299) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nOther than the [Opportunist (2)](/card/02231) combo and <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> helping [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) get the extra action, it is obviously for [Chicago Typewriter](/card/02304) hit which can pump up +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> on itself to reach the over-success clause. If you managed to do so, it is 5 damages! (Maximum of [Shotgun](/card/01029), and here you have even more ammo.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Chicago Typewriter**</span>](/card/02304) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nA big hit with [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) that you spent additional actions should not be underestimated over shooting multiple times for higher damages. Remember that one big hit you pull the chaos bag only once. Besides, you can use [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s action, or get an action back with [Quick Thinking](/card/02229).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Adaptable**</span>](/card/02110) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nYou can use it immediately after purchasing, not having to wait until the next scenario.",

players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQwNjk2EAEKCQoFMzkwNTkQAQoJCgU0MDY5NxABCgkKBTQwMzE4EAEKCQoFNDI1NzYQAQoJCgUzOTA1NxABCgkKBTQxNDYzEAEKCQoFMzkwNTYQAQoJCgU0MjU3OBABCgkKBTQwMzE3EAEKCQoFNDE0NjQQAQoJCgU0MTgyNhABCgkKBTQwNDM1EAE%3D)\r\n\r\n# Tips\r\n\r\n- It is risky to only have 2x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) for fighting, so I also give her 2x [Baseball Bat](/card/01074). She needs that +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to land a hit (on Standard). Things that helps hitting are [Lucky!](/card/01080) and committing [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/01012) (..recommended).\r\n- If you don't get 2x [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689), you still have 2x [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064), but that's it for investigation.\r\n- Spell Asset are expensive so 2x [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) should be used til the end. [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) can help a bit but often you are looking to play with her <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and reluctant to just pop it for resources.\r\n- With [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033), her <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> starts at 4 which is at the range that [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) and [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) can get high value. (Avoid damage treachery, evade for extended fighting.) Keeping 2x [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) makes her resistant to all kinds of treacheries, still having [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) for the worst.\r\n- [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) is often useful for getting a moment where you can play Spell Asset and go back to fight, or if you don't have it yet, continue running away until you found the spell (with [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063)'s help preferably). You can buy a lot of time because you get a free move. You can also commit this to a random <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery test but you will not get a free move since it is not an evasion attempt.\r\n- [Survival Instinct (2)](/card/02235) : This card is cool because not only it affects multiple enemies, they are all **evaded** and not just disengage. That means if you decided not to move, they stay down. In effect, you can kill one of them this round without worry about hoard damage, then next round deal with the rest using full 3 actions because you didn't move.\r\n- [Shrivelling (5)](/card/02306) has higher horror rebound. But at this point in the upgrade plan we have prepared [Peter Sylvestre (2)](/card/02035), [Fearless (2)](/card/02268), and [Moment of Respite](/card/02273) to help offsetting it.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nIf playing Dunwich campaign, your blind run may get very low amount of XP. Don't worry if you can't even complete 2x [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) by the end. \r\n\r\n[Survival Instinct](/card/01081) is actually a very good card inside [Will to Survive](/card/01085) chain, letting you reposition for free to not waste action for your 100% success works. I was quite sad they have to be removed. You can decide to remove 2x [Overpower](/card/01091), 2x [Knife](/card/01086), or 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) instead. But I like those cards more than [Survival Instinct](/card/01081). I have had my fair share of cool [Knife](/card/01086) moment in this deck...\r\n\r\n# 2 Packs Team Compositions\r\n\r\n**2 Packs Deck Guide : The Dunwich Legacy** series is now complete with the following decks :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Shotgun & Magic](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40696)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Zoey Samaras: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Snipe the Wicked](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39059)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Misfortune Foresight](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40697)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Rex Murphy: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Simple Dark Horse Rex Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40318)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Basic Quad-Boost Jenny Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42576)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Jenny Barnes: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : News of Isabelle](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39057)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Jim Culver: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Aureolus-Axe](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41463)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> \"Ashcan\" Pete: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Persistent Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/39056)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Flare Spam Roland Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42578)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Higher Willpower](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40317)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Adaptable / Typewriter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41464)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : Average Dunwich Agnes Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/41826)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [⌂ 2 Packs Deck Guide : 1 Combat Against All Odds](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40435)\r\n\r\nTo help assembling a party made entirely from just 2 packs, I have a tool that let you browse team compositions for 2 players, 3 players, and 4 players, that has manageable amount of card overlaps or even none at all. The result is sorted from low to high overlaps. [**Click here to see all team comps.**](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/assembler?i=CgkKBTQwNjk2EAEKCQoFMzkwNTkQAQoJCgU0MDY5NxABCgkKBTQwMzE4EAEKCQoFNDI1NzYQAQoJCgUzOTA1NxABCgkKBTQxNDYzEAEKCQoFMzkwNTYQAQoJCgU0MjU3OBABCgkKBTQwMzE3EAEKCQoFNDE0NjQQAQoJCgU0MTgyNhABCgkKBTQwNDM1EAE%3D)\r\n\r\n# Emergency Cache (2)\r\n\r\n[Emergency Cache (2)](/card/02194) is a very important card in this deck, deserving a spotlight why it came so early in the upgrade. You may have read negative review of this card, but my Standard Carcosa run with this deck says otherwise. Synergy is high in this deck, and she will always has hope with 2x of this waiting in the deck.\r\n\r\n- You need resources to play [Will to Survive](/card/01085), potentially more than 2 times. This, and [Lone Wolf](/card/02188), then you will arrive at good spot to spend 8-12 resources for this event in addition to 6 for [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) + 2 for [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) and other weapons.\r\n- The draw fuels her token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n- The draw will get you to [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), and also resources to play him ready. There will be some scenarios that you don't see [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) til half way and by that time you maybe short on resources and still no [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). You'll be so happy to \"open a random gift box\" and get Leo out of it...\r\n- The draw will get you to [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014). I see the amulet almost every scenario now because the deck is used up more each time. Conditional draw like [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) is not enough in scenario you can't find evasion chance.\r\n- Quick catch up of cards in hand and resources by playing it, put down [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), and play it again from discard pile. I was able to get back from near 0 resources and hand (was unlucky with the [Lone Wolf](/card/02188)) to the state ready to token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> + play more [Will to Survive](/card/01085) with this. Try evade and move far from enemy with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) when you are trying to get your bearings with [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/02194).\r\n- The draw will trigger [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) faster than you can arrange the play for [Will to Survive](/card/01085), and you will be glad that discard pile wiped didn't have any [Will to Survive](/card/01085).\r\n- After [Scrapper](/card/02193) is added it make sure resources gained translates to survival / killing.\r\n\r\n# Will to Survive tips\r\n\r\n**Definitely find [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)!**\r\n\r\n[Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is overall the best weapon. When you are assembling the combo and got the bat first, careful not to break it before [Will to Survive](/card/01085) come. (Take less fighting tests, use token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to avoid <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>, etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you can't reach equal stat to win (like having [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) but enemy is 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>) and you are already engaged so you can't draw anymore, try using one of [Will to Survive](/card/01085) action to evade + [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) to try getting a miracle single <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> commit card, like [Knife](/card/01086) or [Fire Axe](/card/02032), to keep the chain going.\r\n\r\nGood time to play [Will to Survive](/card/01085) is when [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) is on hand but not played yet. Pad the discard pile with [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/02194) before putting the [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) down and you will have resources ready complete with a commit to reach higher stat from the draw.\r\n\r\nStatic boost is king as otherwise you will rapidly lose commits/resource for each action to turn 0% success into 100% success. This is the task of [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) in addition to weapon boosts.\r\n\r\nThen [Scrapper](/card/02193) is the queen as it covers both kind of actions you are doing in the [Will to Survive](/card/01085) chain, to fill in that last tiny bit with a resource.\r\n\r\nDon't be that stinky fantasizing about epic battle with [Will to Survive](/card/01085) and hog it for too long. Sometimes simply picking 3 clues for sure from a 3 shroud location is worth it if it is a roadblock or Victory point location you must leave soon.\r\n\r\nIn rare situation you will need to boost <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> inside [Will to Survive](/card/01085). But since this deck is a fighter Wendy, there are just 4 cards with <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons : 2x [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) (one should be in play) and 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087). A spare on hand is worth keeping to reach 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to swipe some clues off 4 shroud to mix up with clearing enemies, over discarding for token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. (e.g. When have a choice to discard [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) or extra [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) for token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>, I would keep [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) for his rare <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icon.)\r\n\r\nShe can go around and fix sticky scenario card <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> or Forced tests. (Though it expires before you can do the one saying \"at the end of your turn\" like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) because this one is \"until the end of your turn\".) They are often not higher than 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> or 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, so she just win these easily. Remember that you can <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> on other member's threat area of the same location.\r\n\r\nThe [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) 2 damages trick : It having 3/1 soak means you should use 2 damages before letting go. You want as many actions as possible with [Will to Survive](/card/01085). Even with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) sometimes you hate to spend one to walk into the enemy before you can go super saiyan. So it is either waiting for Hunter to walk here and tank 1 hit, or you walk in as your final action and tank 1 hit, waiting for the next turn you have full actions. [Hired Muscle](/card/02027)'s 3 health let you do just that, soaking 2 damages, to prepare for 4 burst hits the next turn. (Be careful of horror as you have [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015). The only soak is [Leo De Luca](/card/01048).)\r\n\r\n- [Flashlight](/card/01087) can drain supplies and vacuum hard location.\r\n- Since you can't fail you are very good Retaliate destroyer without even evading.\r\n- [Lucky!](/card/01080) can be used to win higher difficulty tests in a pinch, essentially [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) with 1 cost, that [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) can dig up.\r\n- [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) is even more [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) with its <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to succeed at different kind of hard tasks. Commit then play from discard with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014). (Taboo remove this card from play so you cannot play twice with the amulet trick.)\r\n\r\n# The 6 Weapon Cards\r\n\r\nAll these level 0 weapon cards are not removed ever. Let's get accustomed to them. These applies to all weapons : \r\n\r\n- +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> + [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) = 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> vs. 3-4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Quite the sweet spot on Standard, and you have token redraw.\r\n- +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> + [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) = 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. This is at the good spot to get success with [Will to Survive](/card/01085) + [Leo De Luca](/card/01048).\r\n- With 2+ enemies always look to [Oops!](/card/02113) as your first \"hedge\" before any other (token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>, [Lucky!](/card/01080), [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692), ...). Remember that the redirected damage can land on Aloof and Massive enemy. And vs. 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> you can 100% [Oops!](/card/02113) on it.\r\n- Once you get [Scrapper](/card/02193), it can fill in the task of [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) without commitment to keep them around, or use together to reach new height of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> for [Will to Survive](/card/01085) attacks.\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Baseball Bat**</span>](/card/01574) \r\n\r\nThis card might as well be Excalibur with [Will to Survive](/card/01085). You prevent the bat breaking on all hits, as well as reaching 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Get [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) and you get the only repeatable 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> in this deck to play with [Will to Survive](/card/01085). You can perform 8 damages turn with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) on the boss if it happen to not have more than 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. (True story from my Standard Carcosa run.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2x [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) \r\n\r\nThe discard option is good for sniping some specific combat value to proc [Lucky!](/card/01080) or [Oops!](/card/02113) while the other hand is using [Flashlight](/card/01087). It can fill some niche that [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) and [Fire Axe](/card/02032) can't.\r\n\r\nMore interesting is the basic +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> for 1 damage option. Normally that will not make much difference but in [Will to Survive](/card/01085) environment, going from 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is a massive difference, since enemies often starts at 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. [Will to Survive](/card/01085) is either 0% hitting or 100% hitting. The first option let Wendy starts 100% hitting some enemies that are good at <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> but weak at <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\nThen with [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) joining to get you repeated 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> on the first <span class=\"icon-action\"></span>, you can perform \"combo attack\" with [Will to Survive](/card/01085) by using the knife throw only on the final hit, for maximum of 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 damages with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Fire Axe**</span>](/card/02032) \r\n\r\nThis is like a more difficult [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) as it deals 2 damages but it does not give a boost. With [Hired Muscle](/card/02027), you maybe able to reach 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemies on [Will to Survive](/card/01085) turn after you use accurate swing to 0 resource on a higher <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy first.\r\n\r\nRepeated 2 damages with +0 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> (like [.32 Colt](/card/03020) in Carcosa pack but unlimited and cheap to play) is quite special for Wendy to do tricks with [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692). [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) asks for it to be reduced to 0 which is easier with her 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and +0 boost.\r\n\r\nThe unboosted 0 resource swing is handy vs. 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with [Oops!](/card/02113) since you cannot fail more than 2.\r\n\r\n# Talents\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Lone Wolf**</span>](/card/02188) \r\n\r\nGet rich so you can have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), play [Will to Survive](/card/01085) many times, afford [Hired Muscle](/card/02027), and pump into [Scrapper](/card/02193).\r\n\r\nWhen playing multiplayer and you start the round together, simply play later and have the other player left first to still get a resource.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Pickpocketing**</span>](/card/01546) \r\n\r\nPut down so you have healthy amount of cards to perform token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. [Scrapper](/card/02193)'s +<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> can help get you more evades, trading resources into card draw.\r\n\r\n# Early scenario tips\r\n\r\nIt will be hard before we get [Hired Muscle](/card/02027) and [Will to Survive](/card/01085). Your attacks are numbered by these 6 cards : 2x [Oops!](/card/02113) (commit), 2x [Overpower](/card/01091), 2x [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192). Consider them \"ammo\" for your unlimited use weapons.\r\n\r\nThis concentration of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> skill icons gets better when [Will to Survive](/card/01085) (<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>) and [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) (<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>) joins later.\r\n\r\nA commit and spending 1-2 resources down to 0 resource to land [Fire Axe](/card/02032), or use [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) can get up to 5-6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. From there, your token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> should be able to land the hit on 3-4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy. Keep healthy hand with [Pickpocketing](/card/01046).\r\n\r\n# Oops... here in the discard pile again\r\n\r\nThis card looks like a lot of fun, but even in this deck geared for it, it is HARD to use. \r\n\r\nThe primary function of this card is improving commit icon density of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. 2x [Oops!](/card/02113), 2x [Overpower](/card/01091), 2x [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192), 2x [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692), 2x [Will to Survive](/card/01085) (only commit when going to play with amulet) = a lot of chances to 5+ <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> for dry [Baseball Bat](/card/01074). Giving Wendy a choice to kill when 2 HP enemy arrives, instead of just evade.\r\n\r\nCommit is nice, though, it gets very annoying in the discard pile. It is very hard to \"get through\" [Oops!](/card/02113) to something valuable like [Lucky!](/card/01080) or [Will to Survive](/card/01085) behind it with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) since you must find 2 enemies first, and it cost 2 resources too!\r\n\r\nSo plan ahead when you have to commit for <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> if it would obscure something you want to replay or not.\r\n\r\n# Willpower icon drought\r\n\r\nAnother notable weakness is how this deck has 0 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> commit icon, no pump (unlike <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> that [Scrapper](/card/02193) covers), and no [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093)! \r\n\r\nHer 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> will be serviceable together with token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and [Lucky!](/card/01080). But a couple of unfortunate failures will hit her hard on the horror especially you have to account for [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) too, and only [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) can take 1 horror safely.\r\n\r\n[Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) joins much later so you can use its <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> commit. But if you are worried (e.g. playing Carcosa campaign), changing [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) / [Knife](/card/01086) / [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) to [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) / [Dig Deep](/card/01077) may help with that. (Removing [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) will reduce how often she can redraw tokens.)",

No longer 100% pick-and-play on any combinations, but I countered this by providing exhaustive team compositions and how to fix overlaps provided at the bottom of this page. Have fun committing cards!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40739)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40740)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - \"Skids\" O'Toole](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40741)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40742)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40743)\r\n\r\nps. When you decided to purchase one more Investigator Expansion, check out my [2 Packs Deck Guide series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon&name=Packs+Deck+Guide)!\r\n\r\nLastly, if you like the idea of my decks, it would help many more fellow new investigators like you to find these starter decks if you press the <span class=\"fg-survivor\">like (♥) button above</span>. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like the premise of [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks), a Revised Core Set-based series of deck which has absolutely no overlap no matter what amount of players and team compositions (\"pick-and-play\"), yet better than what the official manual provided.\r\n\r\nBut going for perfect zero overlap may **compromise skill commit icon density**. From my experience leading a group of beginners throughout Night of the Zealot, Skill cards are delightful. It feels great to be able to instantly throw in what you just draw to pass tests, and even get some bonus draws to recover from bad starting hand. They also provide the game's most basic team play feature : By pitching a helping commit at the same location. Skill cards are satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nI think Asset cards has too much weight on typical starter decks (and therefore highly dependent on mulligan policy). After an unfortunate spiraling down session they can barely do anything, new players often express that everything seems to depend on finding and stacking up static boost Assets and fight Asset fast enough before enemy comes, if they can't then they have no chance of comeback ever since everything takes Attack of Opportunity then.\r\n\r\nIf you are experienced player trying to get new players to join : It is unfortunate that cannot control luck of draw for anyone. The next time maybe better, but you have limited onboarding session to impress and get new players hooked with the game. **Skill card is that solution** to smooth out any bad start and allow more happy-go-lucky play style for everyone.\r\n\r\nBy giving up the perfect zero overlap, here's my alternate take of starter decks : [Skill Balanced Starter Decks series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=5argon&name=Skill+Balanced+Starter+Decks), which each deck greedily use Skill cards without concern of sharing with the other decks in the series. ([Guts](/card/01089), [Perception](/card/01090), [Overpower](/card/01091), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093))\r\n\r\nIt also distributes well double-icon non-Skill cards over starting deck and through the upgrade plan. ([Evidence!](/card/01022), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [First Aid (3)](/card/01683), [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094)) Upgrade plan also try as much as possible to not replace good icon cards while adding more.\r\n\r\n# Easy deck overlap resolution\r\n\r\nThis series **does care** about card overlaps. Therefore even though there are some combinations that cannot be played together since they want the same cards, the resolution is simple : Just move around the Skill cards and you are ready to play.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory enough for me. Compared to Killbray's Better Starter Deck mathematically perfect 10-10-5 possible combinations for 2-3-4 player count, I managed to get **9-7-2 possible combinations** with zero or easy to resolve overlaps.\r\n\r\nI have exhaustively list all those team compositions in a dedicated section at the bottom, categorized by player count, along with an overlap resolution if it has some. **You can use that section to pick a team matching your party size, perform overlap resolution as suggested, and immediately start the game.**\r\n\r\n# Let's go on a full campaign!\r\n\r\nThis series of deck encourages you to take them to full length 8 scenarios campaign. I do this by including an upgrade guide with enough XP spending plan for an entire campaign for each deck, and also some tips to use the upgraded decks. Cards to be swapped in are in the Side Deck section. Side Deck is designed to have zero overlap between all 5 decks in the series.\r\n\r\nFFG has moved to new distribution format where you can buy Investigator Expansion and Campaign Expansion separately. This is a good news, it means if you try out Night of the Zealot and is eager for longer campaign to see what the game has to offer, just one more box of any Campaign Expansion is required.\r\n\r\nThat is in theory. But community is often quick to state that Revised Core Set cards are not enough for full campaign, and then something like \"You will run out of options\", \"Dunwich Investigator Expansion is essential\", or \"Recommended to get some Investigator Starter Deck first\". While additional products are all useful and these suggestions are becoming the norm, more and more spending requirements in addition to the Campaign Expansion box put off some players with less funding from even getting the Campaign Expansion box.\r\n\r\nRevised Core Set is viable to have good time in a campaign on Easy or Standard. They just lacked variety and fancy combos. But in my opinion, card variety is secondary to full-length experience any new players should try out ASAP. Players may have to \"put up with\" using .45 Automatic and Physical Training to the end for all I care, campaign play is still insanely fun. There should be no other minimum purchases for campaign experience than : Revised Core Set + Campaign Expansion.\r\n\r\n# Main Deck? Side Deck?\r\n\r\nThe \"Side Deck\" section is meant to be higher XP cards waiting to be added to your deck. The \"Deck\" section consists of all 0 XP cards that you start the 1st scenario with. So if you gather both Deck and Side Deck on starting the game, you don't have to go back to your big card collection to pick things between scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have prepared some upgrade plans below to swap cards between Main Deck and Side Deck, but you are free to disagree and purchase in different orders or even different cards than suggested.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Beat Cop</span>](/card/01518) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Beat Cop</span>](/card/01528) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Beat Cop</span>](/card/01518) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Beat Cop</span>](/card/01528) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Barricade</span>](/card/01538) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Police Badge</span>](/card/01527) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">6 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Barricade</span>](/card/01538) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Police Badge</span>](/card/01527) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">8 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Magnifying Glass</span>](/card/01530) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Magnifying Glass</span>](/card/01540) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">9 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Magnifying Glass</span>](/card/01530) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Magnifying Glass</span>](/card/01540) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">10 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Knife</span>](/card/01586) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Extra Ammunition</span>](/card/01526) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">11 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Knife</span>](/card/01586) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">Extra Ammunition</span>](/card/01526) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">12 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Flashlight</span>](/card/01587) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">First Aid</span>](/card/01683) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">15 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Flashlight</span>](/card/01587) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian small\">First Aid</span>](/card/01683) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">18 XP</span>|\r\n|　|  |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | **Extra (v.

But if it looks like fun, go for it! Don't let anyone force you to not use what you want to try out. Many said that the first \"real\" big gun is [Lightning Gun](/card/02301) in Dunwich pack and then, justify the Dunwich purchase as \"staple\". But the point of this series of deck is to prevent that kind of thinking which cost you more and more before you know you love the game or not.\r\n\r\nThe 18 XP breakpoint can be used to try out the Standalone Scenario. Remember to add 2 Random Basic Weakness according to the standalone rule.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nSince he can choose to activate his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to get a clue if he is the one last shotting an enemy, try kill-stealing!

But if you are already +2 over the test difficulty, just Fight and take the risk of friendly fire may leads to speedier progress and more time to farm XP.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to forget that [Knife](/card/01086)'s \"throw\" <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> is more accurate than [.45 Automatic](/card/01016)'s <span class=\"icon-action\"></span>. Therefore this is a good chance to add [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) for a promising 3 damages a hit. (The only thing more accurate is [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) with +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> criteria.)\r\n\r\nTry using [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528)'s <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> damage to deal the final damage to enemy, then grab a clue with Roland's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability, everything with no test involved.\r\n\r\nYou can dual-wield 2x [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) if they comes together. But careful that you may have to take Attack of Opportunity if an enemy suddenly comes and gun is still on your hand. You can pick up [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01040) Fast, but you cannot put down the guns Fast. [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01040)'s <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> pick up ability is great with Roland as he can stop investigating and start fighting with limited use guns, then once guns runs out he can equip back.\r\n\r\n[Working a Hunch](/card/01037)'s \"Fast\" keyword is not just saving an action, it also skips Attack of Opportunity so you can use it while fighting an enemy. For example, if the team is lacking just 1 clue to advance the Act and you are standing with one, but enemy spawns, you still can grab it with 2 resources and advance the Act.\r\n\r\nRoland has advantage with [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) due to it able to refill his signature [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) as well as 2x [.45 Automatic](/card/01016). Later you also have [Shotgun](/card/01029) joining if you can reach high XP before the campaign ends.\r\n\r\n[First Aid (3)](/card/01683) gains Ally healing and heals both damage and horror. It is a good match for [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528) which can also take horror, or to heal yourself when you have failed [Cover Up](/card/01007) and have to start scenario with stray horrors.\r\n\r\nFind some moment to play [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) even if you have no immediate need. 3-4 resources are needed for refreshing [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) or [Police Badge](/card/01027). 2 resources are needed to pump [Physical Training](/card/01017) +<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> against treachery. 2x stays in the deck even after all the upgrades because Guardian class is often poor.\r\n\r\nYou maybe wondering about how to utilize [Barricade](/card/01038). The secret is the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> icon. No kidding! This icon is desperately needed for Roland in addition to 2x [Guts](/card/01089) and 2x [Physical Training](/card/01017). You can let others run from Hunter enemy into you to group up. Then because the Hunter enemy can't follow to whack you, the next turn you can move-fight-fight into it, destroying the [Barricade](/card/01038). You can also continue to use [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) + [Flashlight](/card/01087) to work on remaining clues or try to find a gun before going out to fight the enemy. Anyway, they are quickly replaced by [Police Badge](/card/01027). You get to have fun with them for about 2 scenarios...\r\n\r\n## Talk about campaign play and \"big guns\"\r\n\r\nYou notice there is only one ultimate weapon in your Revised Core Set purchase : [Shotgun](/card/01029). And the upgrade plan even suggests you get [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684) instead. What's going on here?\r\n\r\nIf you came from video games, it may sounds unreasonable to use a \"starting weapon\" like [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) in late scenarios of the campaign. You picture some kind of ultimate weapon, ultimate armor, special summons and killer moves? Towards the end of the game. Therefore this Revised Core Set cards is probably unable to finish a full 8 scenario campaign. Or is it?\r\n\r\nThis game is very well tamed in the stats and damage number. The combat and agility value of the final boss will not bloat to something like 10+. (Remember that those are **accuracy** number, not power number.)\r\n\r\n2 damages is **twice** of 1 damage, 3 actions of all-hit 2 damages is 6. In fact, you will learn this in The Gathering, the 1st scenario of Night of the Zealot, how a single point of damage boost suddenly changes everything. Weapon with 3 damages a hit is entering \"obliteration\" range due to it multiplying with action count. The scaling is not like a typical RPG game that you starts out doing 50 damages, and at the end you are dishing 9999 damages. And finally campaign XP structure limits how far the investigator can go.\r\n\r\nAny 2 damages weapon is in the clear of completing the game. There are just more obstacles and tricky special effect that ruins your plan to use the weapon towards the end of campaign. It's more puzzles and more dilemmas for your decision to throw away or keep the resources. The obstacle leading to the fight also gets harder, not just the fight itself, and you should treat them all as \"fighting\". The encounter deck's treachery often appears as a \"special move\" of the bad guys, despite they are not engaging with you right now. If you resist those, you are already fighting it.\r\n\r\nI would say if the final scenario always start with a Guardian fully equipped and simply pre-engaged with the big bad, many Guardian would simply win. The game make sure the journey to the fight matter. Revised Core Set's weapon upgrade may look weak, but preparation / survival upgrades are plenty. \r\n\r\n[.45 Automatic](/card/01016) or [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) + [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) + [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) is capable of repeating shots and deal as many damages **just fine**. [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006)'s special case +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is at the high end of this game already. **There is nothing wrong that end game weapons are the same as starting one**. Instead, we add upgrade cards to increase the chance of setting this ideal combination up ([Extra Ammunition](/card/01026)) or increase the chance that Roland is still standing at 0 horror count when he finally gets into shooting. ([\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684) / [First Aid (3)](/card/01683) / [Police Badge](/card/01027))\r\n\r\n# Skill icons\r\n\r\n| 　 | Notable skill icons |  |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Guts**</span>](/card/01589) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Overpower**</span>](/card/01591) 　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Working a Hunch**</span>](/card/01537) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Barricade**</span>](/card/01538) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Evidence!**</span>](/card/01522) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**First Aid**</span>](/card/01683) •••　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"I've had worse…\"**</span>](/card/01684) ••••　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n| 　 |  |  |\r\n\r\nGuardian investigators often have low Sanity and \"almost good\" <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. Most <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treacheries deal horror. This put Guardian in an exciting position where committing +1 or +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> probably pass the test, but if somehow failed they falls to critical zone quick.\r\n\r\nThis Roland also has high amount of <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons, so he do not have to always wait for enemies to kill and <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> get clues from 4 shroud locations. You can use [Working a Hunch](/card/01037) for commit when short on resources to play, it is effective if you have [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030). [Evidence!](/card/01022) is often better to hold and wait for enemies, but scenario <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> tests sometimes come and you will be glad this card has <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> too. (e.g. Parley with someone, some roadblock needing <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to even continue.)\r\n\r\n## Willpower talks\r\n\r\nSince Roland has just 5 Sanity, but also with \"exciting\" 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, it worth talking about resisting <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests that would deal horror to you.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 kinds of <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests, one that is fail-by, and one that is fixed high horror (usually 2 horror).\r\n\r\n- Fail-by is capable of dealing more horror, but at the same time resisting partially can soften the horror.\r\n- The fixed one (usually at 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test) tempt you to get about +2 over the difficulty to avoid it, or admit defeat without doing anything since you receive the same penalty.\r\n\r\nThe fail-by kind looked scary due to its maximum horror capable when you get <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>, but I think the fixed kind is more important for Roland's 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> that is **almost** able to pass it. Focus on getting to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> (on Standard). Here's how :\r\n\r\n- [Guts](/card/01089) is the most convenient way, you can pop it with zero setup! And you even get a draw for passing the test! (It's the whole point of this Skill Balanced Starter Decks series.)\r\n- [Barricade](/card/01038). The card's ability may look wack, but the commit is GOOD. One icon only gets him to 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, but I found this great for the fail-by kind. You likely get 0-1 horror at this stat.\r\n- After you get [First Aid (3)](/card/01683) late campaign, that can also be committed for <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. Given that this card can heal horror, it maybe a bargain if you managed to resist 2 horror with the commit. (Rather than spending 1 action 2 resources to play, and 2 more actions to heal...)\r\n- Pump [Physical Training](/card/01017). That means you spend 2 to play it first, then you are allowed to spend 2 more to get to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. Good thing is that you can continue using it if you can set it up early, and can also boost <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n- [Police Badge](/card/01027) get his <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to a good 4 number. Now it only cost 1 to pump [Physical Training](/card/01017) to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.\r\n- Use [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) ahead of time so you have enough to pump [Physical Training](/card/01017) when required.\r\n\r\n# Investigator synergy\r\n\r\nWith other decks of my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series :\r\n\r\n- [Dodge](/card/01023) can be used to cancel an attack going to any other investigator at the same location. (You told them how to dodge.)\r\n- If you choose [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), you can drink up Skid's [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) for 3 resources.\r\n- Skids can use [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) or [Elusive](/card/01050) to drop enemies for Roland to defeat and <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> get clues or [Evidence!](/card/01022).\r\n- If Agnes uses [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) and got an enemy, you can defeat it for a clue <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> or [Evidence!](/card/01022).\r\n- [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) can fill up Skid's [.41 Derringer](/card/01047).\r\n- [Police Badge](/card/01027) can give 2 actions to anyone, which Wendy can go crazy inside her [Will to Survive](/card/01085) turn, especially if she has [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). Similar effect for Daisy that is going to use [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) to get multiple evasions / pokes. Use on the one that got Daisy's [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 boost to prolong the benefit.\r\n- Any other investigator at the same location as him can trigger <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> on [Cover Up](/card/01007) on his threat area. (\"You\" became that investigator.)\r\n  - [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) can help fixing it even when standing on difficult location. [Deduction](/card/01039) also works to remove 2 clues.\r\n  - [Agnes Baker](/card/01004)'s [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) or [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) can remove 2 clues from [Cover Up](/card/01007) at once.\r\n\r\n# Team composition\r\n\r\nAll teams possible within my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series, including and not including this deck as a member.\r\n\r\n**Trivia! :** These reduced combinations are due to how my **Daisy** and **Agnes** deck need the same <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards, there is no possible team with Daisy and Agnes at the same time. I can't managed make both fun to play without major overlaps.\r\n\r\nAlso I discovered if I choose to give up just Daisy + Agnes pair, all other pairs are suddenly viable. Daisy + Agnes kind of causing butterfly effect throughout all the decks. e.g. Once you share Agnes's Spell for Daisy's self defense, then Agnes need more Survivor card from Wendy, then Wendy need more Rogue cards from Skids, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry out [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks) instead if you would like to play with Daisy and Agnes together.\r\n\r\n## 2 Players\r\n\r\n9 teams to choose from, **all with 0 card overlaps** :\r\n\r\n- Team 1\r\n  -

No longer 100% pick-and-play on any combinations, but I countered this by providing exhaustive team compositions and how to fix overlaps provided at the bottom of this page. Have fun committing cards!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40739)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40740)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - \"Skids\" O'Toole](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40741)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40742)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40743)\r\n\r\nps. When you decided to purchase one more Investigator Expansion, check out my [2 Packs Deck Guide series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon&name=Packs+Deck+Guide)!\r\n\r\nLastly, if you like the idea of my decks, it would help many more fellow new investigators like you to find these starter decks if you press the <span class=\"fg-survivor\">like (♥) button above</span>. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like the premise of [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks), a Revised Core Set-based series of deck which has absolutely no overlap no matter what amount of players and team compositions (\"pick-and-play\"), yet better than what the official manual provided.\r\n\r\nBut going for perfect zero overlap may **compromise skill commit icon density**. From my experience leading a group of beginners throughout Night of the Zealot, Skill cards are delightful. It feels great to be able to instantly throw in what you just draw to pass tests, and even get some bonus draws to recover from bad starting hand. They also provide the game's most basic team play feature : By pitching a helping commit at the same location. Skill cards are satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nI think Asset cards has too much weight on typical starter decks (and therefore highly dependent on mulligan policy). After an unfortunate spiraling down session they can barely do anything, new players often express that everything seems to depend on finding and stacking up static boost Assets and fight Asset fast enough before enemy comes, if they can't then they have no chance of comeback ever since everything takes Attack of Opportunity then.\r\n\r\nIf you are experienced player trying to get new players to join : It is unfortunate that cannot control luck of draw for anyone. The next time maybe better, but you have limited onboarding session to impress and get new players hooked with the game. **Skill card is that solution** to smooth out any bad start and allow more happy-go-lucky play style for everyone.\r\n\r\nBy giving up the perfect zero overlap, here's my alternate take of starter decks : [Skill Balanced Starter Decks series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=5argon&name=Skill+Balanced+Starter+Decks), which each deck greedily use Skill cards without concern of sharing with the other decks in the series. ([Guts](/card/01089), [Perception](/card/01090), [Overpower](/card/01091), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093))\r\n\r\nIt also distributes well double-icon non-Skill cards over starting deck and through the upgrade plan. ([Evidence!](/card/01022), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [First Aid (3)](/card/01683), [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094)) Upgrade plan also try as much as possible to not replace good icon cards while adding more.\r\n\r\n# Easy deck overlap resolution\r\n\r\nThis series **does care** about card overlaps. Therefore even though there are some combinations that cannot be played together since they want the same cards, the resolution is simple : Just move around the Skill cards and you are ready to play.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory enough for me. Compared to Killbray's Better Starter Deck mathematically perfect 10-10-5 possible combinations for 2-3-4 player count, I managed to get **9-7-2 possible combinations** with zero or easy to resolve overlaps.\r\n\r\nI have exhaustively list all those team compositions in a dedicated section at the bottom, categorized by player count, along with an overlap resolution if it has some. **You can use that section to pick a team matching your party size, perform overlap resolution as suggested, and immediately start the game.**\r\n\r\n# Let's go on a full campaign!\r\n\r\nThis series of deck encourages you to take them to full length 8 scenarios campaign. I do this by including an upgrade guide with enough XP spending plan for an entire campaign for each deck, and also some tips to use the upgraded decks. Cards to be swapped in are in the Side Deck section. Side Deck is designed to have zero overlap between all 5 decks in the series.\r\n\r\nFFG has moved to new distribution format where you can buy Investigator Expansion and Campaign Expansion separately. This is a good news, it means if you try out Night of the Zealot and is eager for longer campaign to see what the game has to offer, just one more box of any Campaign Expansion is required.\r\n\r\nThat is in theory. But community is often quick to state that Revised Core Set cards are not enough for full campaign, and then something like \"You will run out of options\", \"Dunwich Investigator Expansion is essential\", or \"Recommended to get some Investigator Starter Deck first\". While additional products are all useful and these suggestions are becoming the norm, more and more spending requirements in addition to the Campaign Expansion box put off some players with less funding from even getting the Campaign Expansion box.\r\n\r\nRevised Core Set is viable to have good time in a campaign on Easy or Standard. They just lacked variety and fancy combos. But in my opinion, card variety is secondary to full-length experience any new players should try out ASAP. Players may have to \"put up with\" using .45 Automatic and Physical Training to the end for all I care, campaign play is still insanely fun. There should be no other minimum purchases for campaign experience than : Revised Core Set + Campaign Expansion.\r\n\r\n# Main Deck? Side Deck?\r\n\r\nThe \"Side Deck\" section is meant to be higher XP cards waiting to be added to your deck. The \"Deck\" section consists of all 0 XP cards that you start the 1st scenario with. So if you gather both Deck and Side Deck on starting the game, you don't have to go back to your big card collection to pick things between scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have prepared some upgrade plans below to swap cards between Main Deck and Side Deck, but you are free to disagree and purchase in different orders or even different cards than suggested.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Medical Texts</span>](/card/01535) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Encyclopedia</span>](/card/01542) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Medical Texts</span>](/card/01535) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Encyclopedia</span>](/card/01542) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Old Book of Lore</span>](/card/01531) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Old Book of Lore</span>](/card/01686) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">7 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Old Book of Lore</span>](/card/01531) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Old Book of Lore</span>](/card/01686) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">10 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Hyperawareness</span>](/card/01534) |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Bulletproof Vest</span>](/card/01594) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">13 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Hyperawareness</span>](/card/01534) |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Bulletproof Vest</span>](/card/01594) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">16 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">18 XP</span>|\r\n|　|  |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | **Extra** |  |  |  | 18 XP |\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">20 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Unexpected Courage</span>](/card/01593) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Cryptic Research</span>](/card/01543) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">24 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Unexpected Courage</span>](/card/01593) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker small\">Cryptic Research</span>](/card/01543) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">28 XP</span>|\r\n<span class=\"small\">[(View at arkham-starter.com)](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/upgrade?i=ChISBTAxNTM1GgUwMTU0MjACOAIKEhIFMDE1MzUaBTAxNTQyMAI4BAoSEgUwMTUzMRoFMDE2ODYwAzgHChISBTAxNTMxGgUwMTY4NjADOAoKEhIFMDE1MzQaBTAxNTk0MAM4DQoSEgUwMTUzNBoFMDE1OTQwAzgQChISBTAxNTY2GgUwMTU2OTACOBIKCzgSQgVFeHRyYUgBChISBTAxNTY2GgUwMTU2OTACOBQKEhIFMDE1OTMaBTAxNTQzMAQ4GAoSEgUwMTU5MxoFMDE1NDMwBDgcEkwaAlhQKgcKA%2BKGkhABMg0KBENvc3QSBVRvdGFsOgYIARABGAFCAggBSAFQAVocKFZpZXcgYXQgYXJraGFtLXN0YXJ0ZXIuY29tKWABGhgKBAgBEAMSBBIAGgAaCggBEAEgASgBMAEiJmh0dHBzOi8vYXJraGFtZGIuY29tL2RlY2svdmlldy8yNTYyMDg2)</span>\r\n[//]: # (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nYou can use the 18 XP breakpoint to try out Standalone Scenario. Remember to take 2 Random Basic Weakness according to the standalone rule. You can remove one [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) in order to get both [Blinding Light (2)](/card/01069) into your 19 XP-limited deck. (Rely on [Research Librarian](/card/01032) to find that one copy.)\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nDaisy has 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and Lv. 0~2 <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> access that makes you go \"hmm..\". Often the advice is to make her do **only** her primary job, just investigate with 5 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to the best, rather than trying to boost up <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to do Spell stuff. (Notice that [Shrivelling](/card/01060) and [Blinding Light](/card/01066) has **no accuracy bonus**.)\r\n\r\nWhile that is very effective to win scenarios when you have a capable fighter besides you, from beginner's point of view, I believe everyone wants to do many different things on that Action Reference Card in their first few games. It felt bad for the person choosing <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> to be relegated to pure \"worker\" of sorts.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I decided to give her the same exact stuff as <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [Agnes Baker](/card/01004) so she can Fight and Evade with Spells, though you need [Guts](/card/01089) or [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) to get to comfortable level. Variety of actions is the goal of this deck. This decision also caused [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) and [Agnes Baker](/card/01004) to be incompatible to play at the same time in this series of deck. Sorry! But it is for the best onboarding experience for this Daisy deck.\r\n\r\n- She starts with 4x Talent card : 2x [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) and 2x [Hyperawareness](/card/01034). I want <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for self defense but there is no such pair in one card.\r\n- Unlike Roland which has 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and [Police Badge](/card/01027) to keep his 5 Sanity manageable with some commits or pumps, Daisy only has 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to keep her 5 Health and there is no permanent <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> boost for Seeker, and [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) cannot counter treachery either. [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) is your last line of defense, so recommended to play it as soon as you get it. (And keep [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) on hand.) Fortunately, you likely have some funding from [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033). Spend them to live, then work hard to get the resources back.\r\n- [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) replaces into [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) later. Then you will have only 2x [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) talent while the vest take care of <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> test failure damages.\r\n- Find [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) or [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) with [Research Librarian](/card/01032). Keep in mind the librarian's 2 cost, it adds up to the book. If you are waiting for [Research Librarian](/card/01032), it may help to pre-play [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) so you have about 4-5 resources before he came.\r\n- Use free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to spam [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) to gather self defense suite : [Shrivelling](/card/01060) + [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) + [Blinding Light](/card/01066) + [Hyperawareness](/card/01034).\r\n- Keep [Perception](/card/01090) for [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168), keep [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) for [Locked Door](/card/01174).\r\n- Landing [Blinding Light](/card/01066) on the 1st action is critical if you need 1 more action to walk away, since the spooky token rebound condition lose you 1 action. So make it count by adding some [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) pumps.\r\n- Pump +<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> on [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) to get [Deduction](/card/01039) activation on hard location.\r\n- Make sure you don't have engagement and keep using use free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) for others to make them superman.\r\n- Keep your Sanity to play [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) and fix [The Necronomicon](/card/01009). Get [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008) down then you can run [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) and [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) even when you have [The Necronomicon](/card/01009), then you can put up with it instead of taking 3 horror.\r\n- Free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) yourself while engaged will need taking Attack of Opportunity. However this can boost +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for bursting [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) + [Shrivelling](/card/01060) at 6 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemies. Sometimes that worth it! Equip [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) to help with taking AoO.\r\n\r\n# Skill icons\r\n\r\n| 　 | Notable skill icons | |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Deduction**</span>](/card/01539) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Research Librarian**</span>](/card/01532) 　| <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Encyclopedia**</span>](/card/01542) ••　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Guts**</span>](/card/01589) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Unexpected Courage**</span>](/card/01593) 　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Bulletproof Vest**</span>](/card/01594) •••　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Daisy's Tote Bag**</span>](/card/01008) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n| 　 |  |  |\r\n\r\nDaisy has 2 ways of evading : [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) and [Blinding Light](/card/01066). [Blinding Light](/card/01066) is trickier as even though it let you use <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, you only have 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and enemy is likely at 2-3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. Definitely pair [Guts](/card/01089) with [Blinding Light](/card/01066) to get a reassuring 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. Equipping [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) equals survival due to [Blinding Light](/card/01066) as well.\r\n\r\nDaisy sacrifices her hand slots for Tomes and she does not have [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) or [Flashlight](/card/01087). Though, she has [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) that can add more <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n\r\n2x [Perception](/card/01090) may initially look overkill on even 4 shroud location, but there is one big problem that they can fix : [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168). Pay attention if the scenario is using the Chilling Cold set, and prepare for it.\r\n\r\nWhen using [Deduction](/card/01039) on 4 shroud, try adding 1 more <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> with [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) if you feel like [Perception](/card/01090) would be too much.\r\n\r\n[Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) is likely used as <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> with this Daisy. But since you are going to be [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) user sticking to others, [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) is a flex card that can help many different investigators.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that you want to throw her [Tote Bag](/card/01008) for commit more than actually playing it, that's OK! This deck has a lot of <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> blend without caring about [Agnes Baker](/card/01004), that can make use of that <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.\r\n\r\n[Research Librarian](/card/01032) is one of the notable cards because you may not want to play him if you already have all the tomes, or you got [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) on mulligan already and want to find other books with it instead. Therefore, it is quite often that you are relying on his weird <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icon to get a pass on <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery. The key is to pair this commit with [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), or [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) pumps. [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) can be committed similarly, since it is only playable on your turn and Mythos Phase is not yet your turn.\r\n\r\n[Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) is a legitimate <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> commit for your fighter, it is likely that [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) dig up an another copy while you already have one.\r\n\r\n[Encyclopedia](/card/01042) is an unlimited use asset, the 2nd copy you found turns into a handy <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>. Be careful that [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) or [Crypt Chill](/card/01167) may take away your tomes, in that case you may actually want to play the 2nd copy.\r\n\r\n# Investigator synergy\r\n\r\nWith other decks of my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series :\r\n\r\n- Make anyone around you happy with [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) and [Cryptic Research](/card/01043).\r\n- Skids will love your [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> temporary boost to get his [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/03234) dealing \"critical hit\". (3 over success grants him additional action.)\r\n- Skids will also love [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to land his pricey [Backstab](/card/01051) for chunky damage.\r\n- Since [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) boost lasts for an entire Investigation Phase (across all actions) :\r\n  - Roland can go crazy if he pop his [Police Badge](/card/01027) for 2 extra actions.\r\n  - Skids can do the same by buying action for 2 resources. \r\n  - Wendy can get actions from [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), and can obliterate everything with +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> + 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) + [Will to Survive](/card/01085). Adding +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> also let her use [Will to Survive](/card/01085) to vacuum clues from 4 shroud locations.\r\n- [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) can get many valuable cards for others, especially signature only 1x in the deck such as [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) or [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014).\r\n- [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) repeatedly to Roland so he can pair [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) with the guns in play. Naturally that is quite difficult to be doubly lucky like that.\r\n- [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) can mill out Wendy's [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) faster than she put more valuable Event cards in the discard pile.\r\n- [Blinding Light](/card/01066) can cause exhaust for Wendy's [Sneak Attack](/card/01052).\r\n\r\n# Team composition\r\n\r\nAll teams possible within my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series, including and not including this deck as a member.\r\n\r\n**Trivia! :** These reduced combinations are due to how my **Daisy** and **Agnes** deck need the same <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards, there is no possible team with Daisy and Agnes at the same time. I can't managed make both fun to play without major overlaps.\r\n\r\nAlso I discovered if I choose to give up just Daisy + Agnes pair, all other pairs are suddenly viable. Daisy + Agnes kind of causing butterfly effect throughout all the decks. e.g. Once you share Agnes's Spell for Daisy's self defense, then Agnes need more Survivor card from Wendy, then Wendy need more Rogue cards from Skids, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry out [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks) instead if you would like to play with Daisy and Agnes together.\r\n\r\n## 2 Players\r\n\r\n9 teams to choose from, **all with 0 card overlaps** :\r\n\r\n- Team 1\r\n  -

No longer 100% pick-and-play on any combinations, but I countered this by providing exhaustive team compositions and how to fix overlaps provided at the bottom of this page. Have fun committing cards!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40739)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40740)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - \"Skids\" O'Toole](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40741)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40742)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40743)\r\n\r\nps. When you decided to purchase one more Investigator Expansion, check out my [2 Packs Deck Guide series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon&name=Packs+Deck+Guide)!\r\n\r\nLastly, if you like the idea of my decks, it would help many more fellow new investigators like you to find these starter decks if you press the <span class=\"fg-survivor\">like (♥) button above</span>. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like the premise of [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks), a Revised Core Set-based series of deck which has absolutely no overlap no matter what amount of players and team compositions (\"pick-and-play\"), yet better than what the official manual provided.\r\n\r\nBut going for perfect zero overlap may **compromise skill commit icon density**. From my experience leading a group of beginners throughout Night of the Zealot, Skill cards are delightful. It feels great to be able to instantly throw in what you just draw to pass tests, and even get some bonus draws to recover from bad starting hand. They also provide the game's most basic team play feature : By pitching a helping commit at the same location. Skill cards are satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nI think Asset cards has too much weight on typical starter decks (and therefore highly dependent on mulligan policy). After an unfortunate spiraling down session they can barely do anything, new players often express that everything seems to depend on finding and stacking up static boost Assets and fight Asset fast enough before enemy comes, if they can't then they have no chance of comeback ever since everything takes Attack of Opportunity then.\r\n\r\nIf you are experienced player trying to get new players to join : It is unfortunate that cannot control luck of draw for anyone. The next time maybe better, but you have limited onboarding session to impress and get new players hooked with the game. **Skill card is that solution** to smooth out any bad start and allow more happy-go-lucky play style for everyone.\r\n\r\nBy giving up the perfect zero overlap, here's my alternate take of starter decks : [Skill Balanced Starter Decks series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=5argon&name=Skill+Balanced+Starter+Decks), which each deck greedily use Skill cards without concern of sharing with the other decks in the series. ([Guts](/card/01089), [Perception](/card/01090), [Overpower](/card/01091), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093))\r\n\r\nIt also distributes well double-icon non-Skill cards over starting deck and through the upgrade plan. ([Evidence!](/card/01022), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [First Aid (3)](/card/01683), [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094)) Upgrade plan also try as much as possible to not replace good icon cards while adding more.\r\n\r\n# Easy deck overlap resolution\r\n\r\nThis series **does care** about card overlaps. Therefore even though there are some combinations that cannot be played together since they want the same cards, the resolution is simple : Just move around the Skill cards and you are ready to play.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory enough for me. Compared to Killbray's Better Starter Deck mathematically perfect 10-10-5 possible combinations for 2-3-4 player count, I managed to get **9-7-2 possible combinations** with zero or easy to resolve overlaps.\r\n\r\nI have exhaustively list all those team compositions in a dedicated section at the bottom, categorized by player count, along with an overlap resolution if it has some. **You can use that section to pick a team matching your party size, perform overlap resolution as suggested, and immediately start the game.**\r\n\r\n# Let's go on a full campaign!\r\n\r\nThis series of deck encourages you to take them to full length 8 scenarios campaign. I do this by including an upgrade guide with enough XP spending plan for an entire campaign for each deck, and also some tips to use the upgraded decks. Cards to be swapped in are in the Side Deck section. Side Deck is designed to have zero overlap between all 5 decks in the series.\r\n\r\nFFG has moved to new distribution format where you can buy Investigator Expansion and Campaign Expansion separately. This is a good news, it means if you try out Night of the Zealot and is eager for longer campaign to see what the game has to offer, just one more box of any Campaign Expansion is required.\r\n\r\nThat is in theory. But community is often quick to state that Revised Core Set cards are not enough for full campaign, and then something like \"You will run out of options\", \"Dunwich Investigator Expansion is essential\", or \"Recommended to get some Investigator Starter Deck first\". While additional products are all useful and these suggestions are becoming the norm, more and more spending requirements in addition to the Campaign Expansion box put off some players with less funding from even getting the Campaign Expansion box.\r\n\r\nRevised Core Set is viable to have good time in a campaign on Easy or Standard. They just lacked variety and fancy combos. But in my opinion, card variety is secondary to full-length experience any new players should try out ASAP. Players may have to \"put up with\" using .45 Automatic and Physical Training to the end for all I care, campaign play is still insanely fun. There should be no other minimum purchases for campaign experience than : Revised Core Set + Campaign Expansion.\r\n\r\n# Main Deck? Side Deck?\r\n\r\nThe \"Side Deck\" section is meant to be higher XP cards waiting to be added to your deck. The \"Deck\" section consists of all 0 XP cards that you start the 1st scenario with. So if you gather both Deck and Side Deck on starting the game, you don't have to go back to your big card collection to pick things between scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have prepared some upgrade plans below to swap cards between Main Deck and Side Deck, but you are free to disagree and purchase in different orders or even different cards than suggested.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Burglary</span>](/card/01545) |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Elder Sign Amulet</span>](/card/01595) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Burglary</span>](/card/01545) |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Elder Sign Amulet</span>](/card/01595) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">6 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Elusive</span>](/card/01550) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Cat Burglar</span>](/card/01555) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">7 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Elusive</span>](/card/01550) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Cat Burglar</span>](/card/01555) <span class=\"small\">•</span>|<span class=\"small\">1 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">8 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|  |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Charisma</span>](/card/01694) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">11 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01588) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Hot Streak</span>](/card/01557) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">15 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Emergency Cache</span>](/card/01588) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">Hot Streak</span>](/card/01557) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">19 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">.41 Derringer</span>](/card/01547) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">.41 Derringer</span>](/card/01688) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">21 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">.41 Derringer</span>](/card/01547) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue small\">.41 Derringer</span>](/card/01688) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">23 XP</span>|\r\n<span class=\"small\">[(View at arkham-starter.com)](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/upgrade?i=ChISBTAxNTQ1GgUwMTU5NTADOAMKEhIFMDE1NDUaBTAxNTk1MAM4BgoSEgUwMTU1MBoFMDE1NTUwATgHChISBTAxNTUwGgUwMTU1NTABOAgKCxoFMDE2OTQwAzgLChISBTAxNTg4GgUwMTU1NzAEOA8KEhIFMDE1ODgaBTAxNTU3MAQ4EwoSEgUwMTU0NxoFMDE2ODgwAjgVChISBTAxNTQ3GgUwMTY4ODACOBcSTBoCWFAqBwoD4oaSEAEyDQoEQ29zdBIFVG90YWw6BggBEAEYAUICCAFIAVABWhwoVmlldyBhdCBhcmtoYW0tc3RhcnRlci5jb20pYAEaGAoECAEQAxIEEgAaABoKCAEQASABKAEwASImaHR0cHM6Ly9hcmtoYW1kYi5jb20vZGVjay92aWV3LzI1NjIwOTg%3D)</span>\r\n[//]: # (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nThe 19 XP point where you finally got both copies of [Hot Streak](/card/01057) can be used to try out the Standalone Scenario. Remember to add 2 Random Basic Weakness according to the standalone rule. 9 XP version is not recommended, due to [Hot Streak](/card/01057) being very fun with [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024).\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\n- Pair [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) with [Machete](/card/01020) to consistently land hits vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemies.\r\n- With multiple enemies, use your 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to add in Evade action, reducing engagement count back to 1 to maintain 2 damages hit of [Machete](/card/01020). [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) will add <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for plays like this. Note that if you Evade again to no engagement at all, you will not get +1 damage while attacking exhausted enemy.\r\n- Use [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to perform the fade away leading to nearby-location [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) so you do not blow yourself up.\r\n- [On the Lam](/card/01010) to walk around collecting enemies for [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024). You also skip Attack of Opportunity when blasting yourself along with the enemy, if required. More often that kind of play will get you much more than 3 damage printed on the card. (And horror is so unwanted with Skids!)\r\n- [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) is added on upgrade quite fast to help with taking horror from failed <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery. You should have at least 1 after the 1st scenario. Also because [Guard Dog](/card/01021) can't take even a bit of horror, [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) is a good match so you take nothing when doing [Guard Dog](/card/01021) <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> plays. The amulet is part of the reason I let [Roland Banks](/card/01001) have [Beat Cop](/card/01018) instead, so Skids can use the dogs.\r\n- He can try to resist <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> fail-by tests with [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) and [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) as a commit. But sometimes the test is a hard \"if fail, ...\" and the commit is wasted having to boost from his low 2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) is better to just take the punishment and move on.\r\n- You can make desperate [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) play while engaged with enemies with help of [Guard Dog](/card/01021) to intentionally take Attack of Opportunity. This play chip away 1 HP of some enemies before dealing 3 damages, resulting in 4 burst damage. But you do have to take 3 damages too in addition to stray damages from Attack of Opportunity.\r\n- [Cat Burglar](/card/01055)'s <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> buff benefits [Backstab](/card/01051) hit, and [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) success rate.\r\n- [Charisma](/card/01694) to have both [Guard Dog](/card/01021) and [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) online at the same time. 2x [Guard Dog](/card/01021) or 2x [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) are also possible due to no unique star <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> constraint. Due to [Hot Streak](/card/01057), it is possible to afford both allies swiftly as they are drawn.\r\n- Go for [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) +3 over-success with some [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) +<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> pumps and [Opportunist](/card/01053).\r\n- Since you get a kind of trauma matching how you were defeated, he can essentially use [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) to kill himself to get Physical Trauma instead of getting Mental Trauma if he has 3 or less remaining health. If you are engaged with enemies, remember that you have to survive Attacks of Opportunity first before [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) can go off. ([On the Lam](/card/01010) can fix that!)\r\n- [Hot Streak](/card/01057) funds [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) and [Backstab](/card/01051)'s high play cost. Buying them maybe quite painful for 8 XP you have to spend, but remember that they are essentially more [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024)... also helps paying [Hospital Debts](/card/01011) and buying actions.\r\n- You can beg for resources from others on the same location as you when trying to fix [Hospital Debts](/card/01011). This card is easier on high player count.\r\n\r\n# Skill icons\r\n\r\n| 　 | Notable skill icons | |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Overpower**</span>](/card/01591) 　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Manual Dexterity**</span>](/card/01592) 　| <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Unexpected Courage**</span>](/card/01593) 　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Opportunist**</span>](/card/01553) 　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**On the Lam**</span>](/card/01010) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Elder Sign Amulet**</span>](/card/01595) •••　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dynamite Blast**</span>](/card/01524) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n| 　 |  |  |\r\n\r\nCompared to [Roland Banks](/card/01001), Skids doesn't have many double icons to make use of. Passing <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test is also quite hopeless, which I hope [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) can soak up the horror. (Sometimes not that simple, more info below.) You can try resisting with [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093).\r\n\r\nI choose [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) for Skids instead of [Guts](/card/01089) because Skids would just fail-by-less when trying to resist <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests, not enough to get [Guts](/card/01089)'s draw effect on pass. What you get from [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) is that you can shoot guns, do [Backstab](/card/01051), Evade, [Flashlight](/card/01087), etc. all with that <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icons.\r\n\r\n2x [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) can be an offensive card due to [Backstab](/card/01051). Since [Backstab](/card/01051) is very costly and has no built-in boost, you should aim to pair [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) with it as much as possible. (May as well throw in [Opportunist](/card/01053).) \r\n\r\n2x [Overpower](/card/01091) are for landing [Machete](/card/01020) with 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and farm some cards in the process. [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) is also more likely to deal the same damage as [Machete](/card/01020) as he boosts up to 7 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, but you can also gun down exhausted enemy you just Evade (Skid's specialty is that he can Evade then Fight, removing Retaliate in the process) or playing hero by shooting enemies spawned on helpless investigator without engaging first for 2 damage. [Machete](/card/01020) loses the +1 damage on unengaged enemy, on these cases the gun is better. The gun is \"safe\" to kill-steal in the sense that high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> makes it unlikely to cause friendly-fire, and if the bag hands you <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> or -4? The +1 damage is conveniently removed in the process and your friend hurt less than something like [.45 Automatic](/card/01016).\r\n\r\nLater on the upgrade that [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) joins in, 2x [Overpower](/card/01091) became even more potent by giving him an extra action! Just make sure to try this on low <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy (like 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>) to improve the over-success number, and perhaps add [Opportunist](/card/01053).\r\n\r\nSkid lacks double <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons. Single one only available on [Elusive](/card/01050). [Elusive](/card/01050) is likely a card you hold on hand for long time \"just in case\", I recommend you commit it for <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> when you have got [Flashlight](/card/01087) and is going to tackle 4 shroud location to help out. (Would make 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> vs. 2 shroud.)\r\n\r\nNow we arrive at the very annoying <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> problem for Skids.\r\n\r\nI have added [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) very early to \"just fail\" all the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests and take horror head-on. But sticky treachery cards like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) that gives a chance to fix with <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> once per turn, is an another matter. **This is hell on Skids** as it is not a matter of taking horror, he just get stuck with it seemingly **forever**.\r\n\r\nHold onto [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) for this kind of thing, but that is not enough, the key is also adding [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> or [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>. (You may feel bad that you have to throw away [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) that is supposed to be equipped, but imagine if you cannot fix the sticky treachery forever... Yes. Commit it.) You should ask for <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> from your friend as well. [On the Lam](/card/01010) is an another <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> other than [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093). \r\n\r\nOtherwise, try using [Cat Burglar](/card/01055)'s <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to move around to avoid extra action cost of [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164). (This is an Activate action, not Move.)\r\n\r\n# Investigator synergy\r\n\r\nWith other decks of my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series :\r\n\r\n- If you got [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) but no [Backstab](/card/01051), you can help [Agnes Baker](/card/01004) Evade adding to her OK 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. She may need a moment to play/refresh [Shrivelling](/card/01060) and then she can destroy enemies. She is the only 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> investigator in the core set, which would benefit the most from <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> added. (To lesser extent, [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) can use [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) in addition to your [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) commit.)\r\n- Since [Machete](/card/01020) is good with exactly 1 engagement, you can \"receive\" enemies from either [Agnes Baker](/card/01004) or [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) after [Blinding Light](/card/01066) evasion. [Blinding Light](/card/01066) also remove 1 HP from it, if the enemy starts at 3 HP then you can defeat it exactly.\r\n- You can drop enemy for [Roland Banks](/card/01001) to kill for clue with [Cat Burglar](/card/01055)'s <span class=\"icon-action\"></span>.\r\n- Get [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> + 2 boost from [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) to make sure [Backstab](/card/01051) is not wasted.\r\n- Get [Encyclopedia](/card/01042)  <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> + 2 boost from [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) to make use of [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) / [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) over-success feature.\r\n- [Roland Banks](/card/01001) is the best character to hold enemies for your [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) since he has 9 health.\r\n- [On the Lam](/card/01010) can drag enemies to [Wendy Adams](/card/01005) that is going to [Will to Survive](/card/01085) + [Baseball Bat](/card/01074). Wendy don't want to waste her [Will to Survive](/card/01085) on actions without tests such as moving.\r\n- Play first and Evade for [Wendy Adams](/card/01005)'s [Sneak Attack](/card/01052). You have equal <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> value with Wendy but could be better with [Cat Burglar](/card/01055).\r\n- Play [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) with [Agnes Baker](/card/01004)'s [Survival Instinct](/card/01081). Agnes with number of enemies can go first and [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) into your location leaving enemies behind. Then you blast them, no one gets the 3 damages.\r\n- Daisy's [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) can also give him +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> so he can get up from something like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) on his own.\r\n\r\n# Team composition\r\n\r\nAll teams possible within my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series, including and not including this deck as a member.\r\n\r\n**Trivia! :** These reduced combinations are due to how my **Daisy** and **Agnes** deck need the same <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards, there is no possible team with Daisy and Agnes at the same time. I can't managed make both fun to play without major overlaps.\r\n\r\nAlso I discovered if I choose to give up just Daisy + Agnes pair, all other pairs are suddenly viable. Daisy + Agnes kind of causing butterfly effect throughout all the decks. e.g. Once you share Agnes's Spell for Daisy's self defense, then Agnes need more Survivor card from Wendy, then Wendy need more Rogue cards from Skids, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry out [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks) instead if you would like to play with Daisy and Agnes together.\r\n\r\n## 2 Players\r\n\r\n9 teams to choose from, **all with 0 card overlaps** :\r\n\r\n- Team 1\r\n  -

No longer 100% pick-and-play on any combinations, but I countered this by providing exhaustive team compositions and how to fix overlaps provided at the bottom of this page. Have fun committing cards!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40739)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40740)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - \"Skids\" O'Toole](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40741)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40742)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40743)\r\n\r\nps. When you decided to purchase one more Investigator Expansion, check out my [2 Packs Deck Guide series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon&name=Packs+Deck+Guide)!\r\n\r\nLastly, if you like the idea of my decks, it would help many more fellow new investigators like you to find these starter decks if you press the <span class=\"fg-survivor\">like (♥) button above</span>. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like the premise of [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks), a Revised Core Set-based series of deck which has absolutely no overlap no matter what amount of players and team compositions (\"pick-and-play\"), yet better than what the official manual provided.\r\n\r\nBut going for perfect zero overlap may **compromise skill commit icon density**. From my experience leading a group of beginners throughout Night of the Zealot, Skill cards are delightful. It feels great to be able to instantly throw in what you just draw to pass tests, and even get some bonus draws to recover from bad starting hand. They also provide the game's most basic team play feature : By pitching a helping commit at the same location. Skill cards are satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nI think Asset cards has too much weight on typical starter decks (and therefore highly dependent on mulligan policy). After an unfortunate spiraling down session they can barely do anything, new players often express that everything seems to depend on finding and stacking up static boost Assets and fight Asset fast enough before enemy comes, if they can't then they have no chance of comeback ever since everything takes Attack of Opportunity then.\r\n\r\nIf you are experienced player trying to get new players to join : It is unfortunate that cannot control luck of draw for anyone. The next time maybe better, but you have limited onboarding session to impress and get new players hooked with the game. **Skill card is that solution** to smooth out any bad start and allow more happy-go-lucky play style for everyone.\r\n\r\nBy giving up the perfect zero overlap, here's my alternate take of starter decks : [Skill Balanced Starter Decks series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=5argon&name=Skill+Balanced+Starter+Decks), which each deck greedily use Skill cards without concern of sharing with the other decks in the series. ([Guts](/card/01089), [Perception](/card/01090), [Overpower](/card/01091), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093))\r\n\r\nIt also distributes well double-icon non-Skill cards over starting deck and through the upgrade plan. ([Evidence!](/card/01022), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [First Aid (3)](/card/01683), [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094)) Upgrade plan also try as much as possible to not replace good icon cards while adding more.\r\n\r\n# Easy deck overlap resolution\r\n\r\nThis series **does care** about card overlaps. Therefore even though there are some combinations that cannot be played together since they want the same cards, the resolution is simple : Just move around the Skill cards and you are ready to play.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory enough for me. Compared to Killbray's Better Starter Deck mathematically perfect 10-10-5 possible combinations for 2-3-4 player count, I managed to get **9-7-2 possible combinations** with zero or easy to resolve overlaps.\r\n\r\nI have exhaustively list all those team compositions in a dedicated section at the bottom, categorized by player count, along with an overlap resolution if it has some. **You can use that section to pick a team matching your party size, perform overlap resolution as suggested, and immediately start the game.**\r\n\r\n# Let's go on a full campaign!\r\n\r\nThis series of deck encourages you to take them to full length 8 scenarios campaign. I do this by including an upgrade guide with enough XP spending plan for an entire campaign for each deck, and also some tips to use the upgraded decks. Cards to be swapped in are in the Side Deck section. Side Deck is designed to have zero overlap between all 5 decks in the series.\r\n\r\nFFG has moved to new distribution format where you can buy Investigator Expansion and Campaign Expansion separately. This is a good news, it means if you try out Night of the Zealot and is eager for longer campaign to see what the game has to offer, just one more box of any Campaign Expansion is required.\r\n\r\nThat is in theory. But community is often quick to state that Revised Core Set cards are not enough for full campaign, and then something like \"You will run out of options\", \"Dunwich Investigator Expansion is essential\", or \"Recommended to get some Investigator Starter Deck first\". While additional products are all useful and these suggestions are becoming the norm, more and more spending requirements in addition to the Campaign Expansion box put off some players with less funding from even getting the Campaign Expansion box.\r\n\r\nRevised Core Set is viable to have good time in a campaign on Easy or Standard. They just lacked variety and fancy combos. But in my opinion, card variety is secondary to full-length experience any new players should try out ASAP. Players may have to \"put up with\" using .45 Automatic and Physical Training to the end for all I care, campaign play is still insanely fun. There should be no other minimum purchases for campaign experience than : Revised Core Set + Campaign Expansion.\r\n\r\n# Main Deck? Side Deck?\r\n\r\nThe \"Side Deck\" section is meant to be higher XP cards waiting to be added to your deck. The \"Deck\" section consists of all 0 XP cards that you start the 1st scenario with. So if you gather both Deck and Side Deck on starting the game, you don't have to go back to your big card collection to pick things between scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have prepared some upgrade plans below to swap cards between Main Deck and Side Deck, but you are free to disagree and purchase in different orders or even different cards than suggested.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|  |  |  |  | 　Cost | 　Total |\r\n|:-:|:--|:-:|:--|--:|--:|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Scrying</span>](/card/01561) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Rite of Seeking</span>](/card/01689) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Scrying</span>](/card/01561) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Rite of Seeking</span>](/card/01689) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Drawn to the Flame</span>](/card/01564) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Grotesque Statue</span>](/card/01571) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">8 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Drawn to the Flame</span>](/card/01564) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Grotesque Statue</span>](/card/01571) <span class=\"small\">••••</span>|<span class=\"small\">4 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">12 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">14 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01566) |　<span class=\"fg-survivor\">→</span>　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Blinding Light</span>](/card/01569) <span class=\"small\">••</span>|<span class=\"small\">2 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">16 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|  |　→　|[<span class=\"fg-neutral small\">Relic Hunter</span>](/card/01695) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">19 XP</span>|\r\n|　|  |  |  |  |  |\r\n|  | **Extra** |  |  |  | 19 XP |\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Survival Instinct</span>](/card/01581) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Scrying</span>](/card/01690) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">22 XP</span>|\r\n|　　|<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor small\">Survival Instinct</span>](/card/01581) |　→　|<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic small\">Scrying</span>](/card/01690) <span class=\"small\">•••</span>|<span class=\"small\">3 XP</span>|<span class=\"small\">25 XP</span>|\r\n<span class=\"small\">[(View at arkham-starter.com)](https://arkham-starter.com/tool/upgrade?i=ChISBTAxNTYxGgUwMTY4OTACOAIKEhIFMDE1NjEaBTAxNjg5MAI4BAoSEgUwMTU2NBoFMDE1NzEwBDgIChISBTAxNTY0GgUwMTU3MTAEOAwKEhIFMDE1NjYaBTAxNTY5MAI4DgoSEgUwMTU2NhoFMDE1NjkwAjgQCgsaBTAxNjk1MAM4EwoLOBNCBUV4dHJhSAEKEhIFMDE1ODEaBTAxNjkwMAM4FgoSEgUwMTU4MRoFMDE2OTAwAzgZEkwaAlhQKgcKA%2BKGkhABMg0KBENvc3QSBVRvdGFsOgYIARABGAFCAggBSAFQAVocKFZpZXcgYXQgYXJraGFtLXN0YXJ0ZXIuY29tKWABGhgKBAgBEAMSBBIAGgAaCggBEAEgASgBMAEiJmh0dHBzOi8vYXJraGFtZGIuY29tL2RlY2svdmlldy8yNTYyMTE2)</span>\r\n[//]: # (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nYou can use the 19 XP breakpoint to play in Standalone Scenario. Remember to add 2 Random Basic Weakness according to standalone rule.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nThe main theme of this deck is to make it so she is an adequate replacement for Seeker. I often see posts about how beginners often felt like one always need Guardian + Seeker. I give many investigation redundancy here to encourage you to try a party without Seeker. (And also in this series of deck, it is impossible to play Agnes and Daisy together!)\r\n\r\nTo achieve that, this Agnes retains her \"sublayer\" of 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) plays, even after she added 2x [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) into the deck. Together with 2x [Lucky!](/card/01080) and 2x [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), her 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> can do wonders on 2-3 shroud too.\r\n\r\n- With [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689)'s 4 play cost and [Shrivelling](/card/01060)'s 3 play cost, 2x [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) are still needed even if she has [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) to help out a bit. You also have to prepare to pay for [Dark Memory](/card/01013).\r\n- She having no health soak is scary (2x [Leather Coat](/card/01072) are on Wendy's deck as I want her [Scavenging](/card/01073) to have things to grab), but she is unexpectedly fast at 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> + [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) + [Dig Deep](/card/01077)'s <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> pump. Try make use of evasion to not get hit, or weaving in Asset refresh mid-fight. ([Shrivelling](/card/01060), [Holy Rosary](/card/01059), [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063))\r\n- Put [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) down preferably on the turn before Agenda would advance to get a free doom, then keep searching for every Spell in this deck.\r\n- [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) for Spell economy and at the same time perform her horror counter <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. Though, I am not comfortable giving 2x of this card. I use only 1x.\r\n- [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) allows your final action as Evade to be helpful, as normally not moving away would return you to engage with the enemy in the upcoming Upkeep Phase. Possibly use your next round to equip [Shrivelling](/card/01060) to fight back.\r\n- Try a bit of [Dig Deep](/card/01077) +<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> pump to get [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) activation.\r\n- [Flashlight](/card/01087) is for abusing 2 shroud location since you can't fail at 0 difficulty outside of <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>. Also great on 3-4 shroud if you have [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) on hand. (Difficulty reduced to 1-2 means you can surely activate [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) no matter how much you fail by, it is capped to 0.)\r\n- [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) allows getting clues very efficiently, but can end your turn. So try using [Flashlight](/card/01087) a few times to go for [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) first.\r\n- [Blinding Light](/card/01066) and [Blinding Light (2)](/card/01569) has no <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost. Other than [Holy Rosary](/card/01059), try using [Dig Deep](/card/01077) to pump <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> as required to win vs. high <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy. Use them to turn off Retaliate and deal damages at the same time.\r\n- Remember that once you run out of 2x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) and 2x [Blinding Light (2)](/card/01569), there is no more offensive option that deals 2 damages a hit.\r\n- [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/01012) can get draws on 6 Spell **Event** cards all included in this deck : 2x [Blinding Light (2)](/card/01569) + 2x [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) + 2x [Mind Wipe](/card/01068), in addition to 4 Spell **Asset** : 2x [Shrivelling](/card/01060) + 2x [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689).\r\n- [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) allows [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/01012) to be online together with [Holy Rosary](/card/01059), or simply just 2x [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) for a lot of <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.\r\n- [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is generally useful, but my favorite is when having [Lucky!](/card/01080) or [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) on hand. Your chance of success is very high when you have double insurance like that.\r\n- [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is tactical with [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689). This card's accuracy is almost guaranteed on Standard, but you afraid of its turn ending rebound effect, and you want use it as the last action to be safe. Now in crunch time, you can try avoiding fancy tokens with [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071), using it repeatedly in one turn.\r\n- If you got to [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), keep using it to have much more appropriate Mythos Phase for everyone. You can arrange Revelation treachery so it hits your [Ward of Protection](/card/01065). Remember the horror condition because sometimes you can trigger horror counter <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n- If you use [Scrying (3)](/card/01690) on yourself and see [Dark Memory](/card/01013) coming up, you can either prepare resources for it better, or if the deck is currently thick you can use [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) to shuffle the deck.\r\n\r\n# Skill icons\r\n\r\n| 　 | Notable skill icons | |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Manual Dexterity**</span>](/card/01592) 　| <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Survival Instinct**</span>](/card/01581) 　| <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**\"Look what I found!\"**</span>](/card/01579) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | ✮ <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Lucky!**</span>](/card/01580)　|  |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Fearless**</span>](/card/01567) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Scrying**</span>](/card/01690) •••　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Heirloom of Hyperborea**</span>](/card/01012) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n| 　 |  |  |\r\n\r\n✮ Not a Skill card and has no icon, but could serve similar purpose.\r\n\r\nAgnes has the least Skill cards of decks in this series. (And rightfully cards in this deck competes for slots more.) And we gave her mostly <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. The reason is that  : \r\n\r\n- She do all the things with <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and do not need [Overpower](/card/01091) or [Perception](/card/01090) commit.\r\n- Her high 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> need just a push with [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) to be permanently good for both fighting and investigating (+2 on [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689)). No other stats has a permanent boost Asset as cheap and good as [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) in the Revised Core Set. [Fearless](/card/01067) can substitute [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) when it is not found yet, while heal back Sanity for more counter attacks.\r\n- Though it is unlikely that [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) fails, if it did you can still use [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079).\r\n- 3 stat would benefit the most from double icons, so I gave her [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) to avoid damage treachery and Evade when [Blinding Light](/card/01066) isn't found. You can add more with [Dig Deep](/card/01077).\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> is a class of mitigating failure, and she has the class' signature 2x [Lucky!](/card/01080) card. 2x [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) as well. So while it looks like she has low commit, <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> tricks can make up for it.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, Agnes can be quite swingy since it depends on setting up Asset more. (The premise of this series is to reduce swinginess by introducing more Skill cards.) You will have to pay attention to mulligan, and make sure you have some fight/investigation Spell Asset, or [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) to get to the Spell.\r\n\r\n[Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/01012) may not be a good card on starting hand, [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) is much better. By putting [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) down, any time you get [Blinding Light](/card/01066) it's a pretty accurate Evade. Remember that [Shrivelling](/card/01060) has no boost as well and it maybe a problem vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy without [Holy Rosary](/card/01059). (Especially if they Retaliate.)\r\n\r\nOnly [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) can be used effectively with no other setup due to +2 boost. But you may need to pre-play [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) to afford the cost.\r\n\r\n# Investigator synergy\r\n\r\nWith other decks of my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series :\r\n\r\n- [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) evasion can left enemy behind for [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003)'s [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024).\r\n- [Blinding Light](/card/01066)'s weakness is that it is an Evade, which unlike Fight you cannot do so on enemies engaged with other just to chip in some damage and disengage. [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003) has [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) that could drop an enemy for you without spending Engage first.\r\n- [Blinding Light](/card/01066) can get an exhaust for [Wendy Adams](/card/01005)'s [Sneak Attack](/card/01052).\r\n- You can help [Roland Banks](/card/01001) fix his [Cover Up](/card/01007) using your [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) or [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) 2 clues ability. You can activate <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> as long as you are at the same location as him.\r\n\r\n# Team composition\r\n\r\nAll teams possible within my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series, including and not including this deck as a member.\r\n\r\n**Trivia! :** These reduced combinations are due to how my **Daisy** and **Agnes** deck need the same <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards, there is no possible team with Daisy and Agnes at the same time. I can't managed make both fun to play without major overlaps.\r\n\r\nAlso I discovered if I choose to give up just Daisy + Agnes pair, all other pairs are suddenly viable. Daisy + Agnes kind of causing butterfly effect throughout all the decks. e.g. Once you share Agnes's Spell for Daisy's self defense, then Agnes need more Survivor card from Wendy, then Wendy need more Rogue cards from Skids, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry out [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks) instead if you would like to play with Daisy and Agnes together.\r\n\r\n## 2 Players\r\n\r\n9 teams to choose from, **all with 0 card overlaps** :\r\n\r\n- Team 1\r\n  -

No longer 100% pick-and-play on any combinations, but I countered this by providing exhaustive team compositions and how to fix overlaps provided at the bottom of this page. Have fun committing cards!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Roland Banks: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40739)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Daisy Walker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40740)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> \"Skids\" O'Toole: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - \"Skids\" O'Toole](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40741)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Agnes Baker: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40742)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Wendy Adams: [Skill Balanced Starter Decks - Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/40743)\r\n\r\nps. When you decided to purchase one more Investigator Expansion, check out my [2 Packs Deck Guide series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon&name=Packs+Deck+Guide)!\r\n\r\nLastly, if you like the idea of my decks, it would help many more fellow new investigators like you to find these starter decks if you press the <span class=\"fg-survivor\">like (♥) button above</span>. Thank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI like the premise of [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks), a Revised Core Set-based series of deck which has absolutely no overlap no matter what amount of players and team compositions (\"pick-and-play\"), yet better than what the official manual provided.\r\n\r\nBut going for perfect zero overlap may **compromise skill commit icon density**. From my experience leading a group of beginners throughout Night of the Zealot, Skill cards are delightful. It feels great to be able to instantly throw in what you just draw to pass tests, and even get some bonus draws to recover from bad starting hand. They also provide the game's most basic team play feature : By pitching a helping commit at the same location. Skill cards are satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nI think Asset cards has too much weight on typical starter decks (and therefore highly dependent on mulligan policy). After an unfortunate spiraling down session they can barely do anything, new players often express that everything seems to depend on finding and stacking up static boost Assets and fight Asset fast enough before enemy comes, if they can't then they have no chance of comeback ever since everything takes Attack of Opportunity then.\r\n\r\nIf you are experienced player trying to get new players to join : It is unfortunate that cannot control luck of draw for anyone. The next time maybe better, but you have limited onboarding session to impress and get new players hooked with the game. **Skill card is that solution** to smooth out any bad start and allow more happy-go-lucky play style for everyone.\r\n\r\nBy giving up the perfect zero overlap, here's my alternate take of starter decks : [Skill Balanced Starter Decks series](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=5argon&name=Skill+Balanced+Starter+Decks), which each deck greedily use Skill cards without concern of sharing with the other decks in the series. ([Guts](/card/01089), [Perception](/card/01090), [Overpower](/card/01091), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093))\r\n\r\nIt also distributes well double-icon non-Skill cards over starting deck and through the upgrade plan. ([Evidence!](/card/01022), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [First Aid (3)](/card/01683), [\"I've had worse…\"](/card/01684), [Scrying (3)](/card/01690), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078), [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094)) Upgrade plan also try as much as possible to not replace good icon cards while adding more.\r\n\r\n# Easy deck overlap resolution\r\n\r\nThis series **does care** about card overlaps. Therefore even though there are some combinations that cannot be played together since they want the same cards, the resolution is simple : Just move around the Skill cards and you are ready to play.\r\n\r\nThe result is satisfactory enough for me. Compared to Killbray's Better Starter Deck mathematically perfect 10-10-5 possible combinations for 2-3-4 player count, I managed to get **9-7-2 possible combinations** with zero or easy to resolve overlaps.\r\n\r\nI have exhaustively list all those team compositions in a dedicated section at the bottom, categorized by player count, along with an overlap resolution if it has some. **You can use that section to pick a team matching your party size, perform overlap resolution as suggested, and immediately start the game.**\r\n\r\n# Let's go on a full campaign!\r\n\r\nThis series of deck encourages you to take them to full length 8 scenarios campaign. I do this by including an upgrade guide with enough XP spending plan for an entire campaign for each deck, and also some tips to use the upgraded decks. Cards to be swapped in are in the Side Deck section. Side Deck is designed to have zero overlap between all 5 decks in the series.\r\n\r\nFFG has moved to new distribution format where you can buy Investigator Expansion and Campaign Expansion separately. This is a good news, it means if you try out Night of the Zealot and is eager for longer campaign to see what the game has to offer, just one more box of any Campaign Expansion is required.\r\n\r\nThat is in theory. But community is often quick to state that Revised Core Set cards are not enough for full campaign, and then something like \"You will run out of options\", \"Dunwich Investigator Expansion is essential\", or \"Recommended to get some Investigator Starter Deck first\". While additional products are all useful and these suggestions are becoming the norm, more and more spending requirements in addition to the Campaign Expansion box put off some players with less funding from even getting the Campaign Expansion box.\r\n\r\nRevised Core Set is viable to have good time in a campaign on Easy or Standard. They just lacked variety and fancy combos. But in my opinion, card variety is secondary to full-length experience any new players should try out ASAP. Players may have to \"put up with\" using .45 Automatic and Physical Training to the end for all I care, campaign play is still insanely fun. There should be no other minimum purchases for campaign experience than : Revised Core Set + Campaign Expansion.\r\n\r\n# Main Deck? Side Deck?\r\n\r\nThe \"Side Deck\" section is meant to be higher XP cards waiting to be added to your deck. The \"Deck\" section consists of all 0 XP cards that you start the 1st scenario with. So if you gather both Deck and Side Deck on starting the game, you don't have to go back to your big card collection to pick things between scenarios.\r\n\r\nI have prepared some upgrade plans below to swap cards between Main Deck and Side Deck, but you are free to disagree and purchase in different orders or even different cards than suggested.\r\n\r\n# Upgrade guide\r\n\r\n[//]: #

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nWendy has to put up a bit with **no** starting 2x [Lucky!](/card/01080) because I want them on Agnes' deck permanently. However, the first two upgrades add [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584) quickly, which has a draw added to benefit Wendy's token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. This allow playing Wendy and Agnes together and have 4x Lucky! (of different versions) at the same time on the table, a very lucky team. Go for 4 XP and over on the first scenario!\r\n\r\nThe 19 XP breakpoint can be used to play Standalone Scenario. Remember to add 2 Random Basic Weakness according to standalone rule.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nThe most important thing of Wendy on Standard difficulty is that you must be confident to \"wing it\", testing at just +1 over the difficulty or even equal to difficulty. You probably win if you use her token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. Which, often you would win anyway in the first place without the redraw!\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) (1 + 2 = 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>) on 2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy, or [Flashlight](/card/01087) on 4 shroud are looking attractive to try.\r\n\r\nThis mentality requires steady influx of cards on hand to discard, so we have : [Pickpocketing](/card/01046), [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) (removed mid campaign), [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584), [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/01693) to provide the cards. You can also use [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s extra action to just draw cards. Think of it as recharging \"success\" for your next test.\r\n\r\n- [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is the game's first two-handed Asset. This deck teach you the dynamics of transitioning from [Flashlight](/card/01087)/[Lockpicks](/card/01687) \"one-handed phase\" to [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) \"two-handed phase\". [Flashlight](/card/01087) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) runs out, and [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) can break. So you may find natural timing to switch around assets as you play. [Scavenging](/card/01073) rounds out the deck, allowing you to replay them to fix timing problems.\r\n- [Lockpicks](/card/01687) is a very accurate investigation asset, but it exhausts so you only can pick 1 clue per turn. But the real point of high accuracy is to be [Scavenging](/card/01073) activator. [Scavenging](/card/01073) should revive [Leather Coat](/card/01072) / [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) / [Flashlight](/card/01087). If [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is in discard, it is likely you just transitioned out of the 2-handed Wendy mode because it breaks, to be able to equip [Lockpicks](/card/01687) in the first place.\r\n- Add in Evade as much as possible with [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) to draw more cards. For example when getting an enemy while you want to get clues, you can Evade first then use [Flashlight](/card/01087) 2 times to end your turn, which you would get the engagement back next turn since you didn't walk away, but you don't care and repeat the same thing to grab more clues, and more card draw from [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) that refreshed the exhaust in Upkeep.\r\n- [Emergency Cache (2)](/card/01693) added at around 15 XP are expensive XP spending for others, but not for Wendy. The draw is powerful. If you can replay it with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), you will have a lot on hand and a lot of resources to deal with problems.\r\n- [Will to Survive](/card/01085) is your moment of awesome. Without chaos bag, you just declare that you pass the test as soon as you match the test's difficulty! (Remember that normally, matching the difficulty is **not** good, as you need to draw 0s from the bag.)\r\n- [Will to Survive](/card/01085) can burst down 3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemies with [Baseball Bat](/card/01074), or burst down 3-5 shroud location with [Flashlight](/card/01087). ([Lockpicks](/card/01687) is not ideal with [Will to Survive](/card/01085), since it exhausts.)\r\n- [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) extends [Will to Survive](/card/01085) turn to more actions.\r\n- You can also evade inside [Will to Survive](/card/01085) chain if you found some enemy you can't reach its <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. It also get you some draws with [Pickpocketing](/card/01046).\r\n- You can use [Lucky!](/card/01080) inside [Will to Survive](/card/01085) chain by testing under the difficulty intentionally. You instantly \"would fail\", then you pass after the +2.\r\n- To fund [Will to Survive](/card/01085)'s 4 play cost, use [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and again with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), also try just a simple resource action when you have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048).\r\n- [Stray Cat](/card/01076) can evade for [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) without costing an action, but you must prepare it beforehand.\r\n- [Stray Cat](/card/01076) can evade an enemy engaged with another investigator at same location, essentially disengage it and rescue that investigator.\r\n- [Stray Cat](/card/01076) can \"trip\" a Hunter enemy walking into your location and is about to hit you. You use <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window after Hunter enemy move but before it attacks to evade and exhaust it. Yes it will ready soon, but now you get a turn of 4 actions to go at it with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) + possibly [Will to Survive](/card/01085).\r\n- [Charisma](/card/01694) added right at the end of 19 XP zone allows stacking [Stray Cat](/card/01076) with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048). [Stray Cat](/card/01076) would then be replaced with [Aquinnah (3)](/card/01691) if you do really well in a campaign, then you can stack her with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) too. (But expensive to setup!)\r\n\r\n# Skill icons\r\n\r\n| 　 | Notable skill icons | |\r\n|:-:|:--|:--|\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Overpower**</span>](/card/01591) 　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> |\r\n|  | [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Unexpected Courage**</span>](/card/01593) 　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Cunning Distraction**</span>](/card/01578) 　| <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> |\r\n|  | <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Will to Survive**</span>](/card/01585) •••　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n|  | ★ <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Lucky!**</span>](/card/01584) ••　| |\r\n|  | ☆ <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Leather Coat**</span>](/card/01572) 　| <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> |\r\n|  | ☆ [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) 　| <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> |\r\n|  | ☆ [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Wendy's Amulet**</span>](/card/01014) 　| <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> |\r\n| 　 |  |  |\r\n\r\n- ★ : Not a Skill card and has no icon, but provide similar purpose.\r\n- ☆ : [Scavenging](/card/01073)-compatible cards, so they became more attractive to commit.\r\n\r\nBecause she has only 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, 2x [Overpower](/card/01091) is retained. Initially it may looks like her deck (or anyone's deck) should not have any skill cards related to 1-2 skill of that investigator. How come we have [Overpower](/card/01091) that looks like a mismatch here?\r\n\r\nWendy's token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> changes the probability. Repeatable 2 damages / +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> hit from [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is powerful, and once paired with [Overpower](/card/01091) she is at 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. This value is OK to go vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy with token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. Add in [Lucky! (2)](/card/01584) and it is very likely to hit. [Will to Survive](/card/01085) adds more double <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> icons later too. [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) is also good for landing the bat hit. You can think of <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> commits as ammunition for the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074).\r\n\r\n☆ : They are notable skill icons due to [Scavenging](/card/01073). Sometimes you grab them up while using [Lockpicks](/card/01687) with no opportunity to play them yet. Feel free to commit to pass <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> tests, you may able to [Scavenging](/card/01073) them back again. [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) is **also** Item, it is actually practical to commit it for <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> then try get it back later once you are out of trouble!\r\n\r\n[Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) : Don't be distracted by the card's text, this card is just <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> commit to help passing 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery. They are removed soon, but can guide your team's <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> / <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> through <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery on the first few scenarios. \r\n\r\n[Will to Survive](/card/01085) is looking attractive to play 2 times with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014) (Play while the amulet is not here to avoid the bottom-of-deck effect, equip amulet, then you can play it again.) But I think that is too costly! (8 resources) By the time you get enough resources and the right moment to play, the discard is probably puffed up with other Event cards on top of [Will to Survive](/card/01085)... \r\n\r\nMore practical play is **commit** it for <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>. When the devs give good icons to a card, they thought the actual effect is so good that player would not want to commit it. But with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), you can commit **and then** play it too! Commit is not a \"play\" so you avoid the bottom-of-deck effect. You probably have [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) ready to [Will to Survive](/card/01085), so <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> can let you hit normally for 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> first.\r\n\r\n# Investigator synergy\r\n\r\nWith other decks of my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series :\r\n\r\n- You can save your own actions to get exhaust for [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) by letting other investigator Evade for you. [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003) can Evade naturally. Agnes/Daisy can use [Blinding Light](/card/01066). \r\n- Get [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) +2 from [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) to reach the \"golden\" 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> / 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> for [Will to Survive](/card/01085). This number beats almost everything with no chaos bag in the equation.\r\n- Get even more actions for [Will to Survive](/card/01085) from [Roland Banks](/card/01001)'s [Police Badge](/card/01027), in addition to your [Leo De Luca](/card/01048).\r\n- [Stray Cat](/card/01076) can Evade even an enemy engaged with other investigator. (Normally you have to engage first to perform the Evade.) This could be handy for 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> investigators : [Roland Banks](/card/01001) and [Daisy Walker](/card/01002). It would also help [Roland Banks](/card/01001) fight without risk of Retaliate, he cannot turn Retaliate off by evading on his own.\r\n- Purposefully stay with others when you have [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) for a helping commit, since <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery is a popular kind. You may not need it on your own test since you have 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and even can do token redraw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n- You want others to hold off enemies for you while you move into enemy / location that you want to [Will to Survive](/card/01085) **the next turn**. You don't want to do it the same turn you move in, since you want all meaningful actions without the Move to take your awesome [Will to Survive](/card/01085) test-less actions.\r\n\r\n# Team composition\r\n\r\nAll teams possible within my Skill Balanced Starter Deck series, including and not including this deck as a member.\r\n\r\n**Trivia! :** These reduced combinations are due to how my **Daisy** and **Agnes** deck need the same <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> cards, there is no possible team with Daisy and Agnes at the same time. I can't managed make both fun to play without major overlaps.\r\n\r\nAlso I discovered if I choose to give up just Daisy + Agnes pair, all other pairs are suddenly viable. Daisy + Agnes kind of causing butterfly effect throughout all the decks. e.g. Once you share Agnes's Spell for Daisy's self defense, then Agnes need more Survivor card from Wendy, then Wendy need more Rogue cards from Skids, and so on.\r\n\r\nTry out [Killbray's Better Starter Decks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?faction=&author=Killbray&name=Better+Starter+Decks) instead if you would like to play with Daisy and Agnes together.\r\n\r\n## 2 Players\r\n\r\n9 teams to choose from, **all with 0 card overlaps** :\r\n\r\n- Team 1\r\n  -

One of its many improvements is a very clean and logical distribution of the cards in several distinct packages. Among those are the five pre-made and ready-to-play investigator decks. As soon as this was announced, many expected them to be improved versions of the original starter decks, since the limitation of the single class cards no longer applies to the Revised Core. Alas all the prepackaged decks are exactly the same starter decks suggested in the old Core with no change whatsoever.

This deck is designed to capitalize on both of these fronts. It can therefore work optimally for solo play, but it can also work for team play, in which case the focus should switch mainly to enemy management.<br>Including his signature card, Roland has access to 4 very good weapons, plus 2 [Knife](/card/01086) cards to use in a pinch. [Physical Training](/card/01017) can be used in order to further boost his excellent <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> against the most fearsome enemies. But with 2 [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) and 2 [Flashlight](/card/01087) he can also make very good use of his 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to efficiently gather clues from most locations. For the most difficult ones he can further boost his skill with [Perception](/card/01090) and he can even gain two clues in one action thanks to [Deduction](/card/01039). With his ability he can then gain clues without losing tempo and [Evidence!](/card/01022) can allow him to gain multiple clues this way in the same round or it can provide a consistent <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boost for other types of skill tests.<br>\r\nIf multiple enemies are present, Roland can use [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) as a trump card. It's costly, but he has [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) to aid him with that. [Guard Dog](/card/01021) can provide a mean to deal further damage without the need to spend actions or pass skill tests (useful to quickly dispatch those pesky [Acolyte](/card/01169)).\r\nHowever Roland isn't without flaws. While his <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> isn't too bad, his sanity is very low and he needs to be very careful, least he'll meet an untimely demise by failing a skill test on [Rotting Remains](/card/01163). To this end he can once again make use of [Physical Training](/card/01017), but [Guts](/card/01089) is also an option. Additionally [Dodge](/card/01023) can completely nullify an enemy attack, and Roland especially wants to neutralize those that cause Horror, but he can also use it protect his team members. In a pinch [First Aid](/card/01019) can help healing both Horror and Damage, but since it's a very action expensive card, it shouldn't be used unless strictly necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Suggested Upgrades:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nIf Roland is paired with a clue gatherer like Daisy or Wendy, he should aim to improve his fighting power and get more protection from the encounter deck.\r\n[Shotgun](/card/01029) is a very powerful weapon, but it starts in play with only 2 ammo. It is therefore advisable to get [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) as soon you get your first copy of Shotgun. Extra Ammunition can also be used to load the other guns in Roland's possession. Switching Guard Dog with [Beat Cop](/card/01028) is also an option if you wish to avoid two-handed weapons, but you can keep both allies and invest in [Charisma](/card/02158). Remember that allies are also valuable to soak Horror and Damage. If you want even more protection, there's [I've Had Worse](/card/02261) which can also simultaneously provide Roland with resources. With that card Roland no longer needs to fear drawing a <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> on [Rotting Remains](/card/01163) or [Umôrdhoth's Wrath](/card/01158).\r\nIf Roland is playing solo he should probably avoid Shotgun entirely, but [Magnifying Glass](/card/01040) can be played and safely retrieved at no cost whenever you need to free your hand slots. [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) is a powerful tool to boost any kind of skill, but using it causes AoO and so it isn't very viable in combat and when you need to evade. [Police Badge](/card/01027) can improve Roland's <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and then whenever you need it the most you can discard it to gain two extra actions. If Roland suffered 2 or more mental trauma, however, you should consider [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) for the Accessory Slot instead. Finally [Seeking Answers](/card/60227) is a very handy card to use when you need to gain clues from afar from a location with a shroud of 4, especially if affected by [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168) and [Locked Door](/card/01174). \r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Replacing Cards:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n[Barricade](/card/01038) and [First Aid](/card/01019) are the weakest ones and should be the first to be eliminated. If you are focusing on fighting, [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030), [Flashlight](/card/01087) should be your next pick as they don't mesh well with Shotgun. [Evidence!](/card/01022) is also not strictly necessary, but Deduction should be conserved as it can still help your party members. [Knife](/card/01086) is also not really necessary, so it can be replaced instead of the clue gathering tools if you want to keep them. Finally [Dodge](/card/01023) can be removed if you still need space, especially if you have I've Had Worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Improving the Deck:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this deck is primarily intended to be ready-to-play as is without any need for deckbuilding, it is certainly possible to improve it by taking cards from decks that aren't being used in your current campaign. In this case it is certainly a good idea to take skill cards from those, especially [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) and [Overpower](/card/01091). If Skids's deck isn't used, [.45 Automatic](/card/01016), [Beat Cop](/card/01018), [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) and [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) should be retrieved, especially in a fight oriented role. If Daisy's deck isn't used, however, there aren't many cards that you want to take. [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) can be considered, especially in place of Magnifying Glass, but you'll probably need Charisma in order to play him alongside Guard Dog and Beat Cop. See the paragraph above to decide which cards to remove to make space.",

I do not suggest using this for true solo, as it lacks the means to efficiently deal with enemies.\r\nDaisy likes Tomes, both her ability and her <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> effect don't do anything unless she has a Tome Asset in play, so getting at least one as soon as possible should be a priority. [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) is what she should mainly aim to get, as getting extra cards every round for herself or a team member can drastically improve the efficiency of the group. Luckily [Research Librarian](/card/01032) can be very helpful for the purpose of finding it quickly. [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) is however a way more valuable ally, not only providing a constant <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boost, but also granting extra resources. So alongside a Tome asset you should hard mulligan in order to get him. [Medical Texts](/card/01035) is the other non weakness book in the deck, and while it's not a priority, Daisy eventually might need to use it in order to compensate for her very low health (but be aware of the risks). [Working a Hunch](/card/01037) can be used to gain a clue without even spending an action, and it can even overcome the obstacle of a [Locked Door](/card/01174). [Flashlight](/card/01087) is not really necessary, but can help with a location under the effect of [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168). [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) can be enough to Evade enemies with a low Evade value, but it should mainly be used to protect her against cards like [Grasping Hands](/card/01162). [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) can provide the same <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> boost, but it is very versatile and can be used for any kind of skill test. [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) can also boost <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, and between Dr. Milan and [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) Daisy shouldn't lack the resources.  [Blinding Light](/card/01066) is another tool for Daisy to Evade, but It can also be used offensively to deal 1 damage. It is however [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) Daisy's best card in the deck if she needs to Evade or even Fight, since it allows her to use her excellent <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> in place of both <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> until the end of the round. [Knife](/card/01086) isn't a very efficient weapon, but Daisy can still use it to kill weaker enemies like [Swarm of Rats](/card/01159) and she can use the second ability to eliminate a [Ghoul Minion](/card/01160). Under the effect of Mind over Matter it could even be used against very strong enemies and deal a total of 4 damage in 3 actions.\r\n[Ward of Protection](/card/01065) and [Scrying](/card/01061) allow Daisy some degree of Encounter deck manipulation and protection, but the latter is very action costly and should only be used if the scenario allows it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Suggested Upgrades:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n[Encyclopedia](/card/01042) should be Daisy's first upgrade. It's an asset that can improve any skill for the duration of the whole investigation phase and she can use it with her additional action. It's the best Tome she can get and once in her deck it should become her main priority to play it. She mostly wants to use it on a team member. For example Skids can use extra <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to defeat enemies. If there are no enemies, <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> can be chosen instead, so even Agnes can spend a whole turn with a modified <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> score of 4. [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) can basically instantly eliminate an enemy before it can even spawn. It is limited to non-elite and won't really help with enemies that spawn in another location, but it's certainly worth its XP and resource cost. [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) has a very high XP cost, but acquiring 3 cards free of any resource or action cost can be a game changer. Next is [Seeking Answers](/card/60227), which is excellent not only for the sake of gaining 2 clues in one action, but also to investigate a location without actually moving there, or a location under the effect of [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168) and [Locked Door](/card/01174). [Old Book of Lore](/card/06279) is an improvement over the level 0 version, but it shouldn't be a priority. On the mystic side there aren't really many cards that Daisy wants to use. Rather, she might prefer to look among the neutral cards and get [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) in order to be on the safe side against damage. [Charisma](/card/02158) can be taken so that she can still play Research Librarian while Dr. Milan or a Story Asset Ally are already in play.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Replacing Cards:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nThe weakest cards in Daisy's deck are [Scrying](/card/01061) and [Blinding Light](/card/01066). The former is too action costly and provides little benefit, the latter is difficult to use with her mediocre <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. [Flashlight](/card/01087) is not strictly necessary for her, as her <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is high enough already and she has several options to boost it when needed. [Knife](/card/01086) might be useful at the start of the campaign when there's relatively weak enemies, but as enemies become stronger and stronger, it becomes more and more useless and it can be replaced. [Medical Texts](/card/01035) can also be replaced by Bulletproof Vest, as Encyclopedia and Old Book of Lore are far better Tome options. Next on the line is [Research Librarian](/card/01032) especially if there's no Charisma. \r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Improving the Deck:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this deck is primarily intended to be ready-to-play as is without any need for deckbuilding, it is certainly possible to improve it by taking cards from decks that aren't being used in your current campaign. In this case it is certainly a good idea to take skill cards from those, especially [Perception](/card/01090) and [Guts](/card/01089). If Agnes's deck isn't used, Daisy can take [Shrivelling](/card/01060) in order to become a lot more proficient at fighting enemies. She should also replace [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) with [Arcane Studies](/card/01062), since <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> is generally more important. [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) provides a constant <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost and extra sanity, and while Daisy doesn't generally need help with clues, [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) can still prove to be invaluable as it can bypass high shroud locations and [Locked Door](/card/01174). If Roland's deck isn't used, Daisy should consider taking [Deduction](/card/01039), because gaining  clues faster is always useful. See the paragraph above to decide which cards to remove to make space.",

This deck is mainly focused  on defeating enemies, but it can still succeed an investigating, with the right setup. It is therefore viable both in solo as well as in multiplayer in either a fighting oriented role or as a generalist.<br>\r\n[Shrivelling](/card/01060) is Agnes's first and foremost mean to defeat enemies. With her exceptional <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, which can be further boosted with [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) and [Arcane Studies](/card/01062), she can ensure the attack succeeds. The spell can cause her to suffer a horror if a symbol token is drawn, but in Agnes's case that can actually be advantageous, since she can then use her ability to deal further damage.\r\nIn case she can't find Shrivelling or in case she runs out of charges, [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is her backup plan. While Agnes's <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is a mere 2, the Baseball Bat improves it by another 2 points by default, which is enough to allow her to fight weaker enemies like [Swarm of Rats](/card/01159) or [Ghoul Minion](/card/01160). In case of stronger enemies, several cards can be committed for their <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> icons, starting from [Overpower](/card/01091) and [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), but also [Leather Coat](/card/01072) and [Knife](/card/01086). The latter can also be used as a weapon as a last resort. And then, do not make the mistake of thinking that [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) is an economy tool. In Agnes's hands it's a weapon. Since her ability works once per phase, with Forbidden Knowledge she can take avail of any player window in any phase to deal extra damage, including right after a hunter enemy moved in the enemy phase, before they get a chance to attack. Since Sanity for Agnes works mostly as available uses for her ability, you want to divert all unnecessary horror to other cards, like [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) and [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063). [Fearless](/card/01067) can also be used to heal horror so that she can further use her ability.<br>\r\n[Flashlight](/card/01087) can be efficiently used on locations with a shroud value of 2 or lower. Since a modified skill value can never go into negative, she cannot fail in those cases unless she draws a <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> in spite of her 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. For the more difficult locations, she can make use of [Arcane Studies](/card/01062), fueled by [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058), but there's also [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064), which can even bypass a [Locked Door](/card/01174). Be however aware that the extra encounter card could even cost you the game. Ideally you don't want to use it as your last action, in case you draw an enemy, unless discovering 2 clues will immediately end the game.<br>\r\nPlaying [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) might look like a bad idea (who wants an extra doom?), but potentially drawing an extra card every turn can be extremely invaluable, and you definitely want to improve your chances of drawing Shrivelling (be careful of [Dark Memory](/card/01013) though!). You can avoid paying the full round loss penalty by purposely taking damage and assigning it to the Initiate, or you can displace it by playing [Stray Cat](/card/01076), which can be very useful to automatically evade enemies. Finally, and this is the best option, you can play Arcane Initiate on what is commonly called \"The Witching Hour\". Since the Doom Threshold is normally checked only during the Mythos phase, it is safe to put any amount of Doom in play if the Agenda is one Doom from advancing anyway. When the Agenda advances, all Doom in play is removed, and then you'll have a completely clean Initiate to use for as long as you want.<br>\r\nThat being said, this deck is conspicuously lacking \"spell\" cards, and so Arcane Initiate is mostly there in preparation for later \"spell\" purchases. Be aware that [Heirloom of Hyperborea](/card/01012) is not useful until you substantially increase the number of \"spell\" cards.\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Suggested Upgrades:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nIf you want to further expand Agnes's options to deal damage using her <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, you can purchase [Blinding Light](/card/01069). In spite of having Evasion as its main purpose, it actually also deals 2 damage (which is what you normally do with an attack), and it has the potential of dealing a horror to its user, which Agnes can convert into further damage. It's a spell too, so a target for Arcane Initiate. Then if you want to improve Agnes's ability to discover clues, you definitely need to buy [Rite of Seeking](/card/51007). With this card Agnes is practically guaranteed to discover 2 clues from any location in a single action. It has a very harsh punishment if a symbol token is drawn, so ideally it should be used as your last action only.<br>\r\n Regardless of your aims, with [Lucky!](/card/01084) you simply cannot go wrong. No matter the test or the situation, Lucky! is an extra insurance to pass skill tests, and this level 2 version also grants an extra card draw. [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is another all-purpose cards. It has a very steep XP cost, but it can be used multiple times and it drastically improves the chances of succeeding, even having the potential to completely nullify the chances of failure. it is therefore an ideal end-game tool, but since it occupies a hand slot, it might clash with Baseball Bat. Leather Coat should be enough to provide protection against damage for Agnes, but [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) can be considered if you want to be on the safe side. It can also be committed to boost <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> by 2 points.\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Replacing Cards:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n[Stray Cat](/card/01076) and [Knife](/card/01086) are not particularly useful and are therefore primary choices if you need to make space for something more valuable. [Flashlight](/card/01087) can be replaced as well if your group already has an investigator dedicated to gathering clues. The same is true, in a minor degree, for [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) and [Arcane Studies](/card/01062). [Leather Coat](/card/01072) can be removed as well if you are not overly concerned about taking damage. If you still need space, [Fearless](/card/01067) and [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) are not strictly necessary, but it must be worth it.\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Improving the Deck:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this deck is primarily intended to be ready-to-play as is without any need for deckbuilding, it is certainly possible to improve it by taking cards from decks that aren't being used in your current campaign. In this case it is certainly a good idea to take skill cards from those. If Wendy's deck isn't used, you should consider adding [Lucky!](/card/01080), as it is a staple card that can always prove to be useful. [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) is another powerful card. You can take it in place of Drawn to the Flame or even Flashlight. If Daisy's deck isn't used, [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) is always nice to have. [Blinding Light](/card/01066) can also be considered, though it isn't as good as its level 2 version. See the paragraph above to decide which cards to remove to make space.",

This deck is mainly focused on gathering clues and evasion. It is therefore not recommended for solo play.<br>\r\n[Leo De Luca](/card/01048) is the most valuable card in this deck. Ideally you want to play it on your very first turn, as the initial investment pays a lot more the more extra actions you get. It is perfectly fine to spend the first action to gain the necessary 6th resource (albeit playing [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) would be even better), you will gain that back immediately the moment you play Leo de Luca. After that, Wendy should focus on getting [Flashlight](/card/01087), [Perception](/card/01090) and [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079). Those will be her primary tools to discover clues. [Lucky!](/card/01080) can also be used in order to pass investigations that would otherwise fail. Remember that as long as you have cards in your hand, it is fine to try skill tests at a lower margin than normal, because with her ability she can retry the test. Also keep in mind that while this may vary depending on the chaos bag composition, if you have only one card in hand and it would only provide an icon for the skill test, it is generally more convenient to use it to retry the test than to commit it to the test. This means that while Wendy's <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is only a 3, it effectively works more like a 4, as long as you have the cards to spare. Here is where Leo de Luca can truly help, because you can use the extra action however you want, including gaining an extra card every turn.<br>\r\nWendy has then several cards to help evading enemies: [Dig Deep](/card/01077), [Survival Instinct](/card/01081), [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), and since her <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> is very high to begin with, she will hardly need to be closely guarded by a fighter. [Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) can be very powerful, but its high cost hardly ever justifies playing it. [Scavenging](/card/01073) deserves a particular mention, especially if used in conjunction with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014), but [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) is also fine. Basically instead of playing those items you could commit them to skill tests (or discard them with Wendy's ability in the case of Rabbit's Foot), then sooner or later you'll draw a 0 or a +1 while investigating and with Scavenging you'll be able to retrieve those items to commit them over and over again. Of course if a Flashlight is in your discard pile, it should be prioritized.<br>\r\nIf enough events are in the discard pile, you can play Wendy's Amulet instead, so that you can then play the events again. Be aware, however, that [Abandoned and Alone](/card/01015) could throw a wrench on that plan. Also remember that if her amulet is in play, it is more convenient to first commit an event to a skill test (or discard it, with Wendy's ability) and then play it from the discard pile, otherwise you'd only be able to use the card once and it would go directly on the bottom of your deck.<br>\r\nThis deck isn't completely devoid of means to defeat enemies, there are 2 copies of [Backstab](/card/01051) that Wendy can use, and each deals 3 damage. Wendy should save these for any situation where the dedicated fighter needs some help. They are expensive cards, and they don't offer any bonus to the skill test, so they require a proper setup to be effective. [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092), or extra resources to burn with [Dig Deep](/card/01077) should be used to ensure the test doesn't fail; especially if the enemy is engaged with another investigator.\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Suggested Upgrades:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhat's better than Leo de Luca? A [Leo De Luca](/card/01054) that only costs 5 resources, of course. It's a very small improvement, but it enables playing this powerful Ally on the very first action. It only costs 1 XP per card, so it's very affordable. Perhaps even more useful is [Lockpicks](/card/03031), a card that would allow Wendy to investigate once per round with a modified skill of 7. It is however a card that Skids might want to take instead. [Will to Survive](/card/01085) is a very useful end-game card. It's best used when Leo de Luca is in play, so you can take advantage of its effect 4 times. [Close Call](/card/01083) provides Wendy with a mean to dispatch enemies, but it only works if they are not Elite and since they get reshuffled into the Encounter Deck, they might be drawn again. Wendy has the option to purchase more allies: [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) and [Aquinnah](/card/02308) (don't bother with the level 1 version, it's not worth the XP). However, while useful, they can't really compare with Leo de Luca. You could still get [Charisma](/card/02158) to have more than one Ally in play at the same time, but the resource cost might be prohibitive. [Lucky!](/card/01084) improves on the level 0 version by granting an extra card, and Wendy loves extra cards. It isn't exceptionally better than the regular one, and so it should be left to Agnes if she is a party member. [Eucatastrophe](/card/05324) is a solid purchase if you really hate the <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> token. It isn't particularly necessary for Wendy, since she is already very resilient to that, but it works very well with Wendy's Amulet since when in play the <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> token grants an automatic success, meaning that she could even attempt Fighting with her 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Replacing Cards:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n[Knife](/card/01086) is the weakest card in the deck. Wendy's <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is only a 1 and she doesn't really have anything to boost it in this deck. It might still be enough to kill weaker enemies like [Swarm of Rats](/card/01159) or [Ghoul Minion](/card/01160), but even in those cases the rate of success won't be high. \r\n[Cunning Distraction](/card/01078) is another card of dubious utility. Situations with high amounts of enemies concentrated in one place won't be particularly frequent and there are better ways to spend 5 resources. It is however a card that can prove to be useful in The Devourer Below scenario, so keep that in mind. [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) can be removed for more or less the same reasons. It doesn't cost a single resource, however it only benefits Wendy, since she simply disengages from the other enemies, they don't exhaust (and if they are hunters, they will catch up in the Enemy Phase, unless she moves further away). [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) isn't strictly necessary. Extra cards are good, but you need to expect to evade at least 2 enemies, because otherwise it would simply be more convenient to spend an action to draw a card directly. [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) is also not particularly useful if you don't plan to frequently fail skill tests (but there's that scavenging trick to consider). If you feel that you don't really need to fight, you can remove [Backstab](/card/01051).\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Improving the Deck:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this deck is primarily intended to be ready-to-play as is without any need for deckbuilding, it is certainly possible to improve it by taking cards from decks that aren't being used in your current campaign. In this case it is certainly a good idea to take skill cards from those, especially [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093). If Skids's deck isn't used, several options open up to turn Wendy into a more rounded investigator capable of defeating several enemies. [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) and [Overpower](/card/01091) can be retrieved, alongside [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) (even better if later upgraded to the level 2 version). Even if Wendy's <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is abysmal, she can still be successful with enough cards and with her ability. [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) can be retrieved instead to keep her focused on clue while expanding her options to deal damage that don't involve <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Another card that could be very useful is [Elusive](/card/01050), especially in The Midnight Mask scenario.<br>\r\nIf Agnes isn't present, [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is by far a better weapon for Wendy than the Derringer. She'd still need Hard Knocks, however, to really use it reliably. See the paragraph above to decide which cards to remove to make space.",

      "description_md": "<font size=5><b>Introduction:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nThe Revised Core provides a much better ideal starting point than the original Core for whoever wishes to delve into the universe of Arkham Horror The Card Game. One of its many improvements is a very clean and logical distribution of the cards in several distinct packages. Among those are the five pre-made and ready-to-play investigator decks. As soon as this was announced, many expected them to be improved versions of the original starter decks, since the limitation of the single class cards no longer applies to the Revised Core. Alas all the prepackaged decks are exactly the same starter decks suggested in the old Core with no change whatsoever. It is commonly agreed upon that those decks are very underwhelming and that a much better distributions of the available cards can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Objective:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nThis series of decks aims to provide a better alternative to the pre-made decks found in the Revised Core by redistributing the cards in a more sensible manner, while keeping them 100% compatible among each others and preserving their ready-to-play nature. \r\n\r\nFor the rest of the decks, follow these links:\r\n\r\n- [Roland Banks](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/33937/better-starter-decks-roland-banks-1.0)\r\n- [Daisy Walker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/33942/better-starter-decks-daisy-walker-2.0)\r\n- [Agnes Baker](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/33944/better-starter-decks-agnes-baker-2.0)\r\n- [Wendy Adams](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/33945/better-starter-decks-wendy-adams-2.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Strategy Tips:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n\"Skids\" O'Toole is an investigator with generally balanced stats and this deck is meant to allow him to perform various tasks, with a slightly stronger focus on combat. It can therefore work well for true solo purposes as well as in multiplayer, either as an enemy handler or as a generalist.<br>\r\nThe [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) is the only really good weapon in this deck, so it should be prioritized. [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) is the second best weapon choice, but it requires a high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to be truly efficient. For that purpose [Beat Cop](/card/01018) should be found and played as soon as possible for his constant +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> bonus. [Overpower](/card/01091) alone can grant the extra 2 points necessary to deal the Derrigner additional damage, and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) can provide both extra <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and even further damage. [Opportunist](/card/01053) is a skill card that can be committed on any test, but ideally it should be used to further ensure succeeding by 2 points or more and if you are lucky you'll succeed by 3 points and get it back. [Knife](/card/01086) and [Switchblade](/card/01044) are backup weapons, but the latter only provides a benefit if you can raise <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> high enough. [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) can be used for that purpose, though Skids has a lot of uses for resources, including gaining extra actions with his ability. [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is a handy card to fuel his economy, burglary is only worthwhile if you can investigate a location with a shroud of 0 or 1, since it can't be combined with [Flashlight](/card/01087) or other investigation tools. Skids is particularly vulnerable against treacheries, especially [Rotting Remains](/card/01163) and [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164). To that end [Guts](/card/01089) should be used to pass or mitigate the failure of those tests. [Opportunist](/card/01053) can be pitched in as well. With 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Skids is already very proficient at evading enemies. This deck also provides several <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icons to commit against enemies with high Evade value. He can then follow up with [Sneak Attack](/card/01052) to deal damage without even the need to Fight. Skids can also shrug off enemies with [Elusive](/card/01050) or become immune to their AoO with his signature card. [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) is a trump card that can dispatch multiple enemies in one blow, but it's very costly, so you might consider using it for its <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> icon instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Suggested Upgrades:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile Skids's base deck is lacking in both combat and investigation tools, it can be drastically improved, and easily, with the cards included in the Revised Core. [.41 Derringer](/card/03234) and [Lockpicks](/card/03031) should be purchased as soon as possible. The latter is especially powerful, allowing Skids to investigate with a skill of 7. Between that and Flashlight, he can become very efficient at investigating, though it still shouldn't be his primary role. The former grants more reliability in dealing extra damage and can occasionally even award an extra action. [Hot Streak](/card/01057) is very costly in terms of XP, but Skids's full potential can only be reached with a lot of resources and this card offers 7. [Beat Cop](/card/01028) is then a natural improvement over the level 0 version, but if Roland is in the team, he should probably be the one to get it. [Police Badge](/card/01027) can provide the much need <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and even more extra actions when necessary, though [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) should also be considered to simply take the inevitable horror. One Ally is already costly enough for Skids, but more can be taken with [Charisma](/card/02158), at that point [Leo De Luca](/card/01054) and [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) become available options. The former is decidedly the more valuable of the two and you can even consider it over Beat Cop. The latter should only be taken if you want a <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> focused deck. [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) can be very useful to improve the chances of passing a very difficult test, but it costs a lot of XP and shouldn't be a priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Replacing Cards:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\n[Switchblade](/card/01044) is by far the worst card in the deck. Even Knife is a better weapon. [Burglary](/card/01045) is a close second and should be phased out as soon as you get Hot Streak. Do not replace Emergency Cache, as Skids definitely can never have enough resources. [Opportunist](/card/01053) offers very little, and the chance of triggering its effect is very low, unless you are using it with Lockpicks, which isn't really necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=5><b>Improving the Deck:</b></font><br>\r\n\r\nWhile this deck is primarily intended to be ready-to-play as is without any need for deckbuilding, it is certainly possible to improve it by taking cards from decks that aren't being used in your current campaign. In this case it is certainly a good idea to take skill cards from those. If Roland's deck isn't used, [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) and [Machete](/card/01020) should be retrieved; at which point you could safely remove all copies of Knife and Switchblade. [Physical Training](/card/01017) should be taken in place of Hard Knocks, because treacheries like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) can be devastating, and having means to increase <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> can be invaluable. But if Skids is only meant to fight, you can keep both and replace Flashlight instead. If Wendy's deck isn't used, however, there aren't many cards that you want to take. Only take [Backstab](/card/01051) if you are also taking [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092). [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) is a very powerful ally, but Skids won't be efficient in Combat without Beat Cop, so only consider this if fighting isn't his primary role.",

Use a Supply from your [Flashlight](/card/01087) and you are now at a virtual score of 8 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>!\r\n\r\nFor higher shroud locations, you can also commit some of your events to make sure that you always overcommit by at least 3.\r\n\r\n**If there is 1 clue at your location:**\r\n\r\nUse [Burglary](/card/01045) on your location. If you succeed by 2 or more, you will get 3 resources and the clue at your location.\r\n\r\nUse [Seeking Answers](/card/01685) on a connecting location. If you succeed by 2 or more, you will get a clue at the connecting location and one at yours.\r\n\r\n**If there are 2 clues at your location:**\r\n\r\nYou can do a basic _**Investigate._** Action and hope to trigger your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. Use your [Flashlight](/card/01087) to increase your chances.\r\n\r\nYou can also use [Seeking Answers](/card/01685)/[Burglary](/card/01045) and commit [Deduction](/card/01039) to find 2 clues at your location in case of success by 2 or more, and one clue at a connecting location. \r\n\r\n**If there are 3 clues or more at your location:**\r\n\r\nThis is where you really shine, to get a lot of clues at one location, fast.\r\n\r\nEarly campaign, commit [Deduction](/card/01039), use your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n\r\nLater in the campaign, you'll be able also to use your [Deduction (2)](/card/02150), [Ice Picks (3)](/card/08107), [Divination (4)](/card/08103) to empty locations at an unbeatable speed.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Scavenging:**\r\n\r\nYou can probably notice that there is 2 copies of [Scavenging](/card/01073) and not many targets besides the Flashlights. This is because your first upgrade is [Ice Picks (3)](/card/08107), which you can then recycle every time you succeed by 2 or more for an extra clue!\r\n\r\n`Note:` You cannot scavenge the [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) at the same action as you throw it, so you need 2 of them:\r\n\r\n• Play [Ice Pick](/card/08107) A <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>\r\n\r\n• **Investigate.** If you succeed, use the ability of the [Ice Pick](/card/08105) A and discard it to get an extra clue.\r\n\r\n• If you succeeded by 2 or more, you can _Scavenge_ [Ice Pick](/card/08107) B, which is in your discard pile.\r\n\r\n• Play [Ice Pick](/card/08107) B <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> \r\n\r\n• **Investigate.** If you succeed, use the ability of the [Ice Pick](/card/08105) B and discard it to get an extra clue.\r\n\r\n• If you succeeded by 2 or more, you scavenge [Ice Pick](/card/08107) A, which is in your discard pile.\r\n\r\n•• As [Scavenging](/card/01073) exhausts, you can only do this twice per turn, but that's already sick.\r\n\r\nAs every [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) costs 1 resource, we add [Crafty](/card/08123) to our priority upgrades to pay for them. It turns out that it also pays for _Insights_, which is terrific because it's our main Event Trait.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [\"I've got a plan!\"](/card/02107): even though you will have a Damage Dealer by your side, sometimes it's good to be able to handle yourself for a little while.\r\n\r\n• [Preposterous Sketches](/card/02186) is here because [Crafty](/card/08123) will pay for it, and unfortunately, at this stage, it's your only Draw engine (besides your Signature [Search for the Truth](/card/02008)). Note that you do not want to Draw too often as it would mean that you also see your Weakness more often...\r\n\r\n• [Shortcut](/card/02022): You empty locations so fast that you may easily spend half of your actions moving, and it is that many lost actions. [Shortcut](/card/02022) is a cheap, <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> and flexible way of moving around the board faster.\r\n\r\n• [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) is always excellent if it prevents you from putting a Doom on the Agenda or protects you from some nasty Treachery Cards, and you have enough Sanity to pay for it.\r\n\r\n• The Skill Suite (except for [Overpower](/card/01091)) is here to save you from Tests you could have on Encounter Cards or help during some Scenario Tests like Parley. \r\n\r\n• [Hyperawareness](/card/01034) is a great way to spend your overflow of cash to either flee an enemy or succeed a hard <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> test.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the 33xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2036948)\r\n\r\n• [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) x2 - 6xp - Total 6xp\r\n\r\n•• [Ice Pick](/card/08107) boosts your <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> the same as the [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) except that it can also be discarded for an extra clue, and _Scavenged_ back!\r\n\r\n• [Seeking Answers](/card/01685) <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Crafty](/card/08123) x2 - 6xp - Total 12xp\r\n\r\n•• [Crafty](/card/08123) will pay for your [Ice Picks](/card/08107), your [Flashlights](/card/01087), and most of your events, saving you some actions and resources!\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Divination (4)](/card/08103) x2 - 8xp - Total 20xp\r\n\r\n•• The acceleration power of [Divination](/card/08103) is insane, 3 clues in one action, 4 with your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>...\r\n\r\n• [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) x2 - 4xp - Total 24xp\r\n\r\n•• With all these new _Assets_, the Deck can become a bit slow.

With [Zoey's Cross](/card/02006), [Machete](/card/01020)/[.45 Automatic](/card/01016)/[Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) *3, 2 [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) and using your [Guard Dog](/card/01021) or sacrificing your [Beat Cop](/card/01018), you could potentially deal them in 1 turn!\r\n\r\n• To deal more damage later in the campaign, you have: \r\n\r\n•• [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) for an instant damage that you can abuse thanks to [Emergency Aid](/card/02105) and [Bandages](/card/08073). 2 [Beat Cops (2)](/card/01028) on the table means 2 test-less damage on tap.\r\n\r\n•• [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) that allows you to deal damages 3 by 3.\r\n\r\n•• [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029) or [Gang Up](/card/08022) (if [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) and [Bandages](/card/08073) down) to deal 4 damage in one action and finish what's left with your other actions.\r\n\r\n•• [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) that is a luxury update if you need extra damage in the late campaign.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Succeeding at your <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> tests:**\r\n\r\n[Zoey Samaras](/card/02001) has amazing fighter abilities, but only has 4 base <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. We therefore need to boost her stat to improve her chances to succeed tests and gain tempo. Ideally we would reach 7 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> at each tests to make it roughly +3 at any fight action.\r\n\r\n• [Machete](/card/01020)/[.45 Automatic](/card/01016)/[Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) all give +1 to your <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Beat Cop](/card/01018) and later with [Charisma](/card/01694) you can have 2 [Beat Cops (2)](/card/01028) online at the same time, giving you another +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and up to +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) on your [Machete](/card/01020) for 3 times +2 to your fight action.\r\n\r\n• [Overpower](/card/01091) and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) for a boost on a stern test that you may miss.\r\n\r\n• [Bruiser](/card/08122) is also a way to boost your tests once all your weapons are on the table.\r\n\r\nWith all of this, except during the setup, you should always be fighting around 7,8 or even 9 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. This will prevent you from ever missing an attack.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) is a stapler; brings your Machete if you don't find it in your opening hand and after Mulligan. It is an overall better target than the [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) as it is cheaper and does not use Ammo. The [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) is still valid when dealing with multiple enemies.\r\n\r\n• [Dodge](/card/01023) is here, especially at the beginning in case you cannot kill every enemy and in case one has 2 or 3 Horror.\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is your first economy card, upgraded into [On the Hunt](/card/08028) that also brings 3 resources but is fast and also brings you an enemy instead of another Encounter Card.\r\n\r\n• [Protective Gear](/card/08095) is here if you take quite some Mental Trauma, and it can also be paid by [Bruiser](/card/08122).\r\n\r\n• [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) first and [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029) later to deal with your Signature Weakness: [Smite the Wicked](/card/02007) or move around the board quickly to help your partners.\r\n\r\n• [Evidence!](/card/01022) is a bit of a \"fill up card\" that can always speed up the game and is quickly replaced.\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) is here because your natural high level of <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> makes it almost sure that you succeed in an Encounter/Parley Test if you commit [Guts](/card/01089), and it replaces itself which is always great.\r\n\r\n• [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) that I use to access [Machete](/card/01020) and [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) and take 2 physical trauma, that I can heal with [Emergency Aid](/card/02105), and my Allies give me a good Health soak pool if necessary.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2038860)\r\n\r\n• [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) x1 to take [Machete](/card/01020) x2 and [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) x1 - 3xp - Total 3xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Charisma](/card/01694) x1 - 3xp - Total 6xp\r\n\r\n•• To get [Guard Dog](/card/01021) and [Beat Cop](/card/01018) at the same time, or even 2 [Beat Cops](/card/01018).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n• [Beat Cop](/card/01028) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) x2 - 4xp - Total 10xp\r\n\r\n•• You can now tap damage at will and refill your Cops with [Bandages](/card/08073) and [Emergency Aid](/card/02105).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n• [Overpower](/card/01091) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Bruiser](/card/08122) x2 - 6xp - Total 16xp\r\n\r\n•• [Bruiser](/card/08122) is a bit like an [Overpower](/card/01091) every turn and pays for your setup. What is not to like.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n\r\n• [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Gang Up](/card/08022) x2 - 2xp - Total 18xp\r\n\r\n•• With [Bruiser](/card/08122) and [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) down, you deal 5 damages in one action, so much more efficient than the [.45 Automatic](/card/01016). I would keep this card in my hand if I had to deal with multiple enemies, making my Machete ineffective.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Evidence!](/card/01022) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Stand Together](/card/02148) x2 - 6xp - Total 24xP\r\n\r\n•• By this time, your Clue Getter should be good enough to get clues reliably. This also increases your card draw and helps you and your teammate set up.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [On the Hunt](/card/08028) x2 - 6xp - Total 30xp\r\n\r\n•• The same economy, but <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> and brings you more of what you love: enemies.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guard Dog](/card/01021) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029) x2 - 8xp - Total 38xp\r\n\r\n•• Fang is amazing to fight your Weakness and save any lost partner that pulled the wrong enemy during the Mythos Phase.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Brand of Cthugha (1)](/card/08090) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) x1 - 3xp - Total 41xp\r\n\r\n•• More charges and more damage by potentially successful attacks. If you have extra experience in the end, you can also consider buying a second one.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Dodge](/card/01023) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Protective Gear](/card/08095) x2 - 4xp - Total 45xp\r\n\r\n•• Luxury upgrade, in case you have a LOT of trauma. [Bruiser](/card/08122) pays for it, preventing you from some nasty Encounter Cards. \r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Make your own Deck!:**\r\n\r\n• I considered the latest taboo list for this Deck, but if you are new to the game or choose not to, you can always decide not to use the taboo. Get 2 [Machete](/card/01020),  [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) or something and not takes 2 Physical Traumas from [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) :)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• This Deck is made using the EotE Investigator cards. If you only have the Revised Core and Dunwich, you can use [This Link](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2042154) and check the Side Deck for Upgrade suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions ;)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• The [Cyclopean Hammer](/card/08093) is, of course, a weapon of choice for [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001). I didn't add it because I felt like this weapon was a bit too good and made the game a bit less enjoyable after one campaign with it. Now, if you want it, then forget about [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090), [Machete](/card/01020) and get it!\r\n\r\n•• You could imagine also adding [On the Trail](/card/08085) to bump an enemy, get to its location again, grab clues on the way and finish it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Prophetic](/card/08120) is a good alternative to [Bruiser](/card/08122) as it pays for [Fang of Tyr'thrha](/card/08029), [Gang Up](/card/08022) and [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090), but it's a bit less intuitive and gives 1 less damage on your [Gang Up](/card/08022). You could also take 1 copy of each.\r\n\r\n•• If you take [Prophetic](/card/08120), then I would advise you to leave [Protective Gear](/card/08095) behind and take a second [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) instead.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• If you are playing this Deck with only 1 collection and multiple of my pre-made Decks: [BruiZ-oey](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36478/bruiz-oey-monster-cook-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), [Clue Vacuuming Rex](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36402/clue-vacuuming-rex-revised-eote-tdl-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), [True Ma-Jim](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36513/true-ma-jim-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0) or [Pete and the Underdog](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36538/pete-and-the-underdog-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), you can distribute the cards as follow: \r\n\r\n•• Give [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033), [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) to [Rex Murphy](/card/02002)\r\n\r\n•• Give [Scavenging](/card/01073) and [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) to [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005).\r\n\r\n•• Give 1 copy of [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) to [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005) and [Jenny Barnes](/card/02003) as [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001) already has 4 weapons.\r\n\r\n•• Give 1 copy of [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) to [Jim Culver](/card/02004) and 1 to [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005).\r\n\r\n•• Give 1 [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) to [Rex Murphy](/card/02002) and 1 to [Jim Culver](/card/02004).\r\n\r\n•• Give 2 [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) to [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001) and upgrade [Jenny Barnes](/card/02003) with [The Red Clock](/card/08053) earlier.\r\n\r\n•• Give 2 [Bruiser](/card/08122) to [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005) and go for the [Cyclopean Hammer](/card/08093) for [Zoey Samaras](/card/02001).\r\n\r\n•• Give [Divination](/card/08101) to [Jim Culver](/card/02004).",

Pair it with [Lone Wolf](/card/02188), and you have 3 resources at the start of each turn.\r\n\r\n• The Active Way: [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and [Hot Streak](/card/01057) are here to turn one action into good ca$h. Play it while unengaged with an enemy and then go and smash it.\r\n\r\n• [The Red Clock (5)](/card/08058): At every beginning of a turn, you can take the resource on [The Red Clock](/card/08058) and get +4 at your first test (so technically 4 resources that you do not have to spend). With [Lone Wolf](/card/02188), you now have 1 test that you don't need to boost anymore and 4 resources at least at the beginning of each turn to spend on tests. \r\n\r\n•• You can also wait to get another charge to help [Searching for Izzie](/card/02011) with 3 <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> moves without provoking Actions of Opportunity as it doesn't require you to spend an action.\r\n\r\n•• While you are playing with [The Red Clock (2)](/card/08058), you have to _either_ take the resource or add a charge, meaning that you have the +3 once every 2 turns and +1 resource every other turn.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Spend Money:**\r\n\r\n• [Jenny's Twin .45s](/card/02010) is an obvious way to spend your money: the more you spend, the more Ammo you get. Make sure to be fully set up first and keep it for the end of a scenario, before a boss or something.\r\n\r\n• [Arcane Studies](/card/01062) and [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) allow you to boost _any_ test once they are both on the table. The Mythos Phase, [Finding Clues](/card/01687) and [Fighting](/card/01544) are now trivial with to your purchase power.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Boost your Tests:**\r\n\r\nIf you are low on money or you want to save for an expensive [Lion](/card/01048), you also have multiple ways to boost a test:\r\n\r\n• [The Red Clock](/card/08058) that gives you +4 as mentioned earlier\r\n\r\n• [Savant](/card/08052) that brings you <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> on any test.\r\n\r\n• [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) that gives you a <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> and gives you an extra action if you succeed. With the [.41 Derringer](/card/01047) and the [Switchblade](/card/02152), this is a good introduction to the \"succeed by X\" mechanic.\r\n\r\n• [Lockpicks](/card/01687) bring you to a base of 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> for 1 test per turn. \r\n\r\n_Note:_ You cannot commit cards with <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icons to the [Lockpicks](/card/01687) as this is a <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> test to which you add you <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, and you can only commit cards with Icons matching the test you are performing.\r\n\r\n• [Flashlight](/card/01087) before you purchase the [Lockpicks](/card/01687) is a great way to get an indirect +2 to <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.

While the <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> is often the milder Symbol token in the bag, at least when it comes to side effects, it can sometimes also be the harsher modifier when it is based on another part of the scenario (number of the Agenda for example). Turning these into 0s, knowing that there are usually 2 of them, often increases your chances of success significantly.\r\n\r\n**Turning Symbol tokens into <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>:**\r\n\r\n• The first way to find more <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> is to make more tokens \"act\" like <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>. [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) allows you to choose <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> as your sigil and turn every other one in <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>. This is amazing to cancel all the effects and modifiers of Symbol Tokens all at once.\r\n\r\n• With [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) out in Easy/Standard, it means that roughly _HALF_ of the Chaos Bag is 0, +1 or <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> (in the starting bag of TDL Standard, 7 out of 15 Chaos Tokens would be 0 or better).\r\n\r\n•• As mentioned earlier <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> is considered the mildest Symbol Token, therefore it means that [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) turns most of the worst tokens in the bag into a <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>. This is especially good in Hard/Expert where the symbol tokens are punishing even if you succeed.\r\n\r\n**Drawing more <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> tokens:**\r\n\r\n• [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is an excellent way to have a better outcome in your tests. As half of the bag is 0 or more, you can reliably think that you will succeed in any test started at +2 or more with the Statue.\r\n\r\n•• The [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) decreases your chance to end your turn/give you Horror while using [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689)/[Shrivelling](/card/01060) by choosing a Chaos Token without a Symbol.\r\n\r\n•• If you are willing to proxy some cards, then [Olive McBride](/card/04197) is a game-changer for this Deck. Add [Recall the Future](/card/04158) to name always the worst Chaos Token of the bag, and you are now sure to succeed by testing anything at +2 while using [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071).\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **• True Magick:**\r\n\r\nThis Deck evolves into [True Magick](/card/08070) as you gain Experience.\r\n\r\n• [Research Librarian](/card/01032) is the best way to rapidly find your book. [Arcane Initiate](/card/01563) is here to fish for your 1 copy of each of your valuable Spells once you have the [True Magick](/card/08070) tome on the table.\r\n\r\n• Once in play, [True Magick](/card/08070) allows you to play the following Spells that you must keep in your hand:\r\n\r\n•• [Blur](/card/08109) to evade and gain an additional action if you succeed.\r\n\r\n•• [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) as it _Exhausts_ and does not use a charge if you are at the enemy's location. Therefore you can shoot with it, _exhaust_ [True Magick](/card/08070) and then use the Charge on another Spell.\r\n\r\n•• [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) to save the 4 resources and use them more than 3 times (though no more than once per turn...).\r\n\r\n•• [Shrivelling](/card/01060) in complement with [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) to deal 4 damages in 2 actions. The [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) is more a panic button as using it with [True Magick](/card/08070) actually uses your 2 Hand Slots, discarding whatever is in your hands at that same moment such as your [Flashlight](/card/01087) and [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071)). You can still scavenge them later but that's rather impactful.\r\n\r\n•• As you can Attack twice in a turn with the [Enchanted Bow](/card/08118) and [Shrivelling](/card/01060) and we have an extra _Arcane_ Slot available, we use it for [Divination](/card/08101) to be able to also investigate at least twice per turn. \r\n\r\n_Note:_ You cannot use [True Magick](/card/08070) on [Divination](/card/08101) and decide to spend multiple charges as [True Magick](/card/08070) only has 1 at a time (unless you manually add charges to it), so it does not synergise well, and this is why we are only playing [Divination](/card/08101) as a normal Spell.\r\n\r\n• [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) can be applied to the [True Magick](/card/08070) to boost the tests performed while copying a Spell.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Early Game Investigation:**\r\n\r\n[Jim Culver](/card/02004) has a decent 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, so it is possible to consider him as a standard clue getter at the beginning of the Campaign, with a bit of help:\r\n\r\n• [Flashlight](/card/01087) gives free clues on 2 or fewer shroud locations. As they have 3 supplies, they are a great recipient for [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) before you purchase [True Magick](/card/08070). You can also [Scavenge](/card/01073) empty flashlights to always have them available. With [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) by your side, you should be almost sure to succeed in any test on a 3 shroud location without committing any other card.\r\n\r\n• [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) and [Perception](/card/01090) are also good ways to boost Investigation tests for 4 shroud locations or more, and [Perception](/card/01090) replaces itself, making it faster for you to find your better cards.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Scavenging:**\r\n\r\n• [Scavenging](/card/01073) works while doing a Basic Investigation as well as using [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) or [Divination](/card/08101). Any success by 2 or more brings you back 1 _Item_.\r\n\r\n• Early in the Campaign, [Flashlight](/card/01087) is an excellent target as you can play them repeatedly.\r\n\r\n• [Jim's Trumpet](/card/02012) can be committed to Skill Tests for <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and scavenged during successful investigations.\r\n\r\n• The real reason for playing [Scavenging](/card/01073) is later, though, after we upgrade to the [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071). It discards itself when empty, which is perfect as you can get it back right after.\r\n\r\n_Note:_ As the [Grotesque Statue](/card/01071) is discarded after the last charge is spent [(Step 3 of a Test)](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Skill_Test_Timing), you can [Scavenge](/card/01073) it during the same investigation [(Step 6 of a Test)](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Skill_Test_Timing).\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Ritual Candles](/card/02029) is great to mitigate the Symbol Tokens before [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) arrives.\r\n\r\n• [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) is also a good way to speed up Clue Getting or find clues at high shroud locations, and you are not necessarily scared of Encounter Cards with your stats and that many Skill Cards.\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is the best economy card available to mystics at this point.\r\n\r\n• [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) to boost your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and soak [Shrivelling](/card/01060)'s effects and [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\n• [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) is a stapler to prevent yourself from bad Encounter Cards such as [Ancient Evils](/card/01166) and also works while using [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064).\r\n\r\n• All the Skill cards are here because they are replacing themselves and therefore make your better cards accessible faster. [Overpower](/card/01091) is mainly here for Uneven Health Enemies to not burn a [Shrivelling](/card/01060) Charge for 1 damage needed.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/1988421)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Charisma](/card/01694) - 3xp - Total 3xp\r\n\r\n•• To be able to have 2 [Arcane Initiates](/card/01063) and later have [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) and [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) online at the same time.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) x1 + [Ritual Candles](/card/02029) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Nkosi Mabati](/card/08091) x2 - 6xp - Total 9xp\r\n\r\n•• Nkosi is your best way to succeed at almost every test.

We are going to explore that mechanic as well as the [Scavenging](/card/01073) already mentioned in other investigators but never as well exploited as with [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005) that uses unplayed _Items_ to trigger his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and ready [Duke](/card/02014).\r\n\r\nLimiting ourselves to the newly released campaigns, Revised, The Edge of the Earth and The Dunwich Legacy, we will try to show how to make Pete a good flex investigator who can help find clues and fight enemies.\r\n\r\nHold your leeches tight, and let's go!\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Table of Content:**\r\n\r\n• Overview\r\n\r\n• Main Strategy\r\n\r\n• Scavenging\r\n\r\n• Managing your Resources\r\n\r\n• Failing forward\r\n\r\n• Other Cards\r\n\r\n• Upgrade Path\r\n\r\n• Make your own Deck!\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Overview:**\r\n\r\nDifficulty: ★★★☆☆\r\n\r\nEnemy Management: ★★★★☆\r\n\r\nClue-getting: ★★★★☆\r\n\r\nEncounter protection: ★★★★☆\r\n\r\nSurvivability: ★★★☆☆\r\n\r\nEconomy: ★★☆☆☆\r\n\r\nCard Drawing: ★★☆☆☆\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Main Strategy:**\r\n\r\n• Discard _Items_ from your hands to ready [Duke](/card/02014) to get more uses of him and [Scavenge](/card/01073) them back for more use.\r\n\r\n• Earn money while investigating with [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) and spend them while fighting with your [Fire Axe](/card/02032) to activate [Dark Horse](/card/02234).\r\n\r\n• Fail forward, using [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) and [Lucky!](/card/01080) to get the best out of your unlucky Token pulls.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Scavenging:**\r\n\r\n[\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> allow you to discard any card from your hand to ready [Duke](/card/02014). What does that mean?\r\n\r\n• Gain +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> at investigation and a potential _Move_ action prior to the investigation \r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\n• Gain +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and deal 1 extra damage\r\n\r\nWe can see that [Duke](/card/02014) is a significant acceleration, giving us the equivalent of 1 extra action (whether it's a move or additional damage) and better chances of success. We should try to use it as often as possible, and to do so, the best way is to discard _Items_ from your hand.\r\n\r\n[Scavenging](/card/01073) lets you recur _Items_ from your discard pile if you succeed at an investigation by 2 or more. Meaning that if you ready [Duke](/card/02014) by throwing away an _Item_, you can use the good boi to investigate and get it back immediately in case of success by 2.\r\n\r\nLater in the campaign, [Scavenging](/card/01073) is also used for recurring [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) that is fast, so it comes back on the table easily as it is paid by both [Bruiser](/card/08122) and [Crafty](/card/08123), allowing you to maintain [Dark Horse](/card/02234) online longer.\r\n\r\nOverall, the targets for readying [Duke](/card/02014) are the 2nd copy of [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075), [Fire Axe](/card/02032), [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030).\r\n\r\n_Note:_ You cannot [Scavenge](/card/01073) an item at the same turn when it is emptied or committed. You will have to empty it or commit it to a test, succeed or fail, discard it, and then scavenge it during another successful by 2 investigations. In our situation, though, if you discard the _Item_ to ready [Duke](/card/02014), you can get it back immediately after using him to investigate.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Managing your resources:**\r\n\r\nThis Deck benefits from having 0 resources to get +1 to your skills thanks to [Dark Horse](/card/02234). \r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways of using them: Paying for cards or boosting your stats with [Fire Axe](/card/02032) and [Plucky (3)](/card/08081)\r\n\r\nThe idea of the Deck is to gather resources during turns when you need to investigate, thanks to [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) (that I advise you to play with Taboo in order not to spoil the game too much). You are already investigating with +3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> with [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030), [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) and later [Plucky (3)](/card/08081). These boosts all apply to your tests using [Duke](/card/02014) which brings you at 7 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. If need be, you can also decide to spend resources to boost your <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> thanks to [Plucky (3)](/card/08081).  Make sure to use [Plucky (3)](/card/08081) after a fight or you may loose it quite fast.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to fighting, try not to engage a fight with more than 3 resources. This is because 3 resources spent in your [Fire Axe](/card/02032) gives you +6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> bringing you to 8 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, you can then use [Duke](/card/02014) with Skill cards, or [Bruiser](/card/08122) and [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) to boost other attacks with the [Fire Axe](/card/02032). This deck should be good enough for you to reliably land 3 2-damage attacks during one turn after the setup.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Failing Forward:**\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while, you will not be able to overcommit, and an unlucky pull will make you fail your test. \r\n\r\nWell, cry no more!\r\n\r\nIf you failed by 2 or less, [Lucky!](/card/01080) will bring you back to success, or if you are brought to 0 (on purpose or not), you can play [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) and ready [Duke](/card/02014) immediately.\r\n\r\nOr [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) will reward you with a card, and you will still have a chance to get 2 clues with [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079).\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Flashlight](/card/01087) is here either to be committed for +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and be [Scavenged](/card/01073), or to be played if you find it before [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030).\r\n\r\n• [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) is here to be used on [Fire Axe](/card/02032) for trying to succeed at attacking once you are already at 0 resources.\r\n\r\n• [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) is an incredible way to balance the fact that there are only 2 weapons in 30 cards.\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) and [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) are here to pass Encounter Tests, boosting your relatively high base stat.\r\n\r\n• [Overpower](/card/01091) and [Perception](/card/01090) are good to commit during actions with [Duke](/card/02014) on hard tests to make it as sure as possible not to waste that action.\r\n\r\n• [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) is good to balance your 2 base <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. You will most likely spend it for a 4-shroud location and make it rather easy for you to collect a clue there thanks to your other static boosts, leading you to +3 on a basic Investigate action with [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) and [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) on the table.\r\n\r\n• [Bruiser](/card/08122) boosts your [Fire Axe](/card/02032) attacks when you do not have money anymore to commit and pays for you to replace your [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) when you scavenge it.\r\n\r\n• [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) will give you <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> if you have [Bruiser](/card/08122) on the table, which should be enough to pass any test with just this card.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the Full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2047386)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Plucky (3)](/card/08081) x2 - 6xp - Total 6xp\r\n\r\n•• With [Plucky (3)](/card/08081), you make it to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> which should protect you from most Encounter Tests.

Add a [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028), and you can defeat most early enemies in one attack. Later with [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025) and [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08092), you deal damage 3 by 3.\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Aid](/card/02105) and [Inspiring Presence](/card/03228) recharge your [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) to trigger [Mark](/card/03001)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> as often as possible.\r\n\r\n• With [Guts](/card/01089), [Say Your Prayers](/card/03116) and [Combat Training (3)](/card/08027) to pay for <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, laugh at any test that is not <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span>\r\n\r\n[![On-The-Hunt.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gkgC9k5m/On-The-Hunt.png)](https://postimg.cc/WhJWgjTH)\r\n\r\n###  <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:royalblue;\"> **Deal Damage:**\r\n\r\nThe main reason you would choose [Mark Harrigan](/card/03001) is that you want to burst enemies.\r\n\r\n• You can use basic <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> tests and later [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025) simple attacks to finish the least damage or for 1hp enemies.\r\n\r\n• [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) is impressive early in the campaign as you can reliably deal with 3hp enemies that are common. \r\n\r\n• [Bandolier](/card/02147) + [.32 Colt](/card/03020) are here to use one single action for 2hp enemies \r\n\r\n• [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025) and [Brand of Cthugha (1)](/card/08092) are here for their capacity to deal 5 damage in 2 actions and 7 damage in one turn. `Small Spoiler:` in The Path to Carcosa, that is enough to kill every enemy in the campaign.\r\n\r\n• You then upgrade to [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) to better deal with multiple enemies at once.\r\n\r\n• With [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025), [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092), [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) and [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028), you can deal up to 14 damage in one turn!\r\n\r\n•• Note that you can still attack with [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025) even when it is exhausted, but you cannot use the ability for a 3-damage attack anymore.\r\n\r\n•• We do not upgrade to [Butterfly Swords (5)](/card/08025) since it's a 2 XP difference with [Butterfly Swords (2)](/card/08025) + [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) and the damage output of the combo is higher. In higher player counts, I would still consider going with [Butterfly Swords (5)](/card/08030). In this situation, both options are valid, and it is up to you and how you like playing.\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:royalblue;\"> **Manage Health/Sanity:**\r\n\r\n• If you do not heal yourself, you can use [Sophie](/card/03009) 4 times before you start having issues with her. Because of the limited healing options in the card pool, I advise you to spare her unless really needed, and if possible pair her with [Guts](/card/01089) or [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) for <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> tests before you purchase [Combat Training (3)](/card/08027).\r\n\r\n• Ideally the main reason to trigger your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> is with the [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) that you can recharge with [Emergency Aid](/card/02105) and [Inspiring Presence](/card/03228). Keep one copy [Emergency Aid](/card/02105) in your hand in case you happen to take more than 4 damage and you need to flip [Sophie](/card/03009) back to her good side.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span>\r\n\r\n[![Let-Me-Handle-This.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Fshv56Hg/Let-Me-Handle-This.png)](https://postimg.cc/4n2qpBtm)\r\n\r\n###  <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:royalblue;\"> **Absorb the Scenario Tests:**\r\n\r\nTo provide your Clue-getter with an open field to investigate and move the game forward, you need to pass as many other tests as possible for the team.\r\n\r\nThis involves:\r\n\r\n• Killing enemies\r\n\r\n• Doing Scenario tests on locations or parleying. If it is a <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, leave it to your <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> that can pass it easily, otherwise you can succeed any other test:\r\n\r\n•• <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests: [Guts](/card/01089) + [Sophie](/card/03009) make you 7 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, which should be enough to succeed any <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> on the first try. If things get out of hands, [Say Your Prayers](/card/03116) is your safety net and you should keep it for defensive use, `Soft spoiler:` _especially for this campaign that deals a lot of Horror._\r\n\r\n•• <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> tests: first [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) + [Sophie](/card/03009) and then you simply buy your way with [Combat Training (3)](/card/08027) as the Deck is really cheap and you should be able to stack resources easily.\r\n\r\n• [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022) is a good way to protect your Clue Getter from a test that would highly impact the game and their tempo. With [Guts](/card/01089), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) or [Sophie](/card/03009), you are +4 at the test, which should be enough to pass almost any test.\r\n\r\n• Finally, it is possible to use your own actions to discard specific weaknesses like [Chronophobia](/card/02039) for another Investigator.\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:royalblue;\"> **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264) improves your consistency significantly by attaching enablers to make sure that you can play your critical Assets as early as possible.\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) [Sticks to the Plan](/card/03264) to be able to play your Assets as soon as you draw them.\r\n\r\n• [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) also [Sticks to the Plan](/card/03264) and makes sure that you find a weapon if you didn't have it after Mulligan.\r\n\r\n• [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) [Sticks to the Plan](/card/03264) for an emergency attack if you do not find your weapons early enough, or an evade if you arrive late to a location with a big enemy.\r\n\r\n• Here are the cards to attach to [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264) in order:\r\n\r\n1. [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184), to access your weapons as fast as possible\r\n1. [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) that your purchase right after [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264). If you do not have that 1xp to get it, you can still place [Shortcut](/card/02022).\r\n1. [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and then [On the Hunt (3)](/card/08028). \r\n\r\n•• As [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264) exhausts, the strategy is as follows: If you have a weapon in your hand at the start, play it during your first turn and use [On the Hunt](/card/08028)/[Emergency Cache](/card/01088) to gain money back immediately. Keep [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) for when you cannot kill an enemy in the same turn. If you do not have a weapon in your starting hand, use [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) on your Turn 1. Hopefully, you find a weapon, and if you don't and draw an enemy on your first Mythos Phase, you can always use [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023) to either kill it or evade it and move somewhere else. We do not use [Ever Vigilant](/card/03023) since there are too few Assets in the Deck to make it worth it.\r\n\r\n• [Shortcut](/card/02022) allows you to come back to your Clue-getter faster if you were split for any reason, also improving your chances to kill the enemy at the same turn as you enter its location.\r\n\r\n• [On the Hunt](/card/08028) is fantastic to fish enemies, especially the ones with Victory Points so that you can help your whole team improve their Decks over the campaign.\r\n\r\n• [First Aid (3)](/card/01683) is an alternative upgrade in case you are taking horror traumas and you want to prevent a spiral that would kill [Mark Harrigan](/card/03001).\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"> </span>\r\n\r\n[![Carcosa-Mark.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MK6qCG6p/Carcosa-Mark.png)](https://postimg.cc/4nSDtsHD)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:royalblue;\">**Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n\r\n• [Beat Cop](/card/01018) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01518) x2 - 4xp - Total 4xp\r\n\r\n•• You can now use them to deal 1 test less damage, and every time you do, you draw one card.

The pinacle of <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> cluever mechanic.\r\n\r\n• [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) is a centrepiece of this Deck, giving you +1 clue as often as you can pay for them. \r\n\r\n• [Newspaper (2)](/card/03313) gives you an extra clue every time you emptied your pool, which is actually quite often, especially in smaller player counts.\r\n\r\n• [Eon Chart (4)](/card/08100) theoretically gives you 1 more <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> Investigate Action that can be considered as an extra clue, though it involves another test. The Move action allows you to dedicate more other actions to investigate.\r\n\r\n•• With [Scavenging](/card/01073), you can recycle your [Eon Charts](/card/08100) which is already insane, but even better: exhaust and use the last charge on [Eon Chart](/card/08100) to get + 1 Move and +1 Investgation.

Bring <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> [Strange Solutions](/card/02263) and 2 [Emergency Cache (3)](/card/03239) to refill them with Supplies or bring resources based on what you need the most.

The reason for this is that this card is simply too good to not take with anyone that can grab them from their discard pile or cycle their Deck fast enough to see them regularly, especially with such a small collection.

To increase your tempo, you should aim at 2 things: not failing any investigation and grabbing more than 1 clue per investigation.\r\n\r\n• The classic way of finding clues for a <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> is the [Lockpicks (1)](/card/01687). They are not the best in [Sefina Rousseau](/card/03003) but investigating with 6-7 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is nothing to be shy about. \r\n\r\n•• Since you have 2 hand slots available, you can investigate with the lockpicks twice per turn. It is also unlikely that you discard them as you would need to not succeed by 2 five times to discard your first [Lockpicks](/card/01687), which never happened in my testing phase. \r\n\r\n•• Your boosts for your [Lockpicks](/card/01687) will come from [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151), [St. Hubert's Key](/card/03269) and [Moxie (3)](/card/08056) pushing you to a max of 9 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) supported by [Divination](/card/08101) are great to leverage your high <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to investigate for more clues each turn. When the campaign advances and shrouds are higher, you upgrade to [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) for the +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> bonus for the test.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) is great especially at the beginning when the Enemies are not that fierce yet. Your high defensive stats (<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>) and [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) make the threat level of other Treacheries rather low.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Winds of Power](/card/08063) is excellent here as when it is placed under [Sefina Rousseau](/card/03003), it plays as soon as you draw it, to add 2 Charges to one of your Spells. If used on [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689), it turns into 4 potential clues.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:green;\"> **Tutoring:**\r\n\r\n[Stars of Hyades](/card/03013) is a card of the particularly annoying kind as it shuffles back into the Deck. First of all, it breaks down what makes you particularly good and fun to play. It also slows down dramatically your Draw power, which is already limited. If you draw it 3 times, that is as if your Deck is roughly 10% bigger. So you want to mitigate this, and the best way to decrease its impact on you is to [Tutor](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/975421/what-heck-does-tutor-mean) cards from your Deck.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• Your main mitigation tool will be [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066). This card is the true MVP of this Deck. Based on the cards you reveal, you have multiple ways to mitigate your weaknesses:\r\n\r\n1. Place them at the bottom of the 6 cards, which gives you a bit of time to prepare\r\n2. Place [Foresight](/card/08064) just before your weakness so that you can discard it when you should draw it.\r\n3. Place [Black Market](/card/08055) or another [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066) just before your weakness to remind yourself to play it as soon as you draw it to have another chance to dodge it. [Black Market](/card/08055) will shuffle the Deck after it is over. \r\n4. Other strategies based on the specifics of that weakness like some resources just after [Paranoia](/card/01097) or [Moxie (3)](/card/08056) to absorb damage.\r\n\r\n•• If you are already in a comfortable situation, you can also use [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) on [Mark Harrigan](/card/03001) or [William Yorick](/card/03005) to help them find their Weapons or Allies.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Black Market](/card/08055) lets you reveal 5 cards, do not trigger revelation on Weaknesses, and let you play Assets/Events from this pool of cards. You can play it after [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066) to make sure that you get the best value out of it.\r\n\r\n•• Note that cards revealed this way cannot be committed to skill tests as the wording says \"Play\" and not \"Commit\".\r\n\r\n•• Play it on [William Yorick](/card/03005) and give access to his [Lucky!](/card/01080), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), [Emergency Cache](/card/01088), [Bandages](/card/08073), [Schoffner's Catalogue](/card/08072), [Jury-Rig](/card/08074) and the like to every other player (including you).\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n[![Dario.png](https://i.postimg.cc/m2dYWtsL/Dario.png)](https://postimg.cc/F7LdjFz8)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:green;\"> **Making and Spending Resources:**\r\n\r\n**Generating a lot of resources:**\r\n\r\n• [David Renfield](/card/03112) also brings you a welcome <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> along with a loooot of resource. Remember that you do not have to add a Doom each time you use him. Use him as soon as you play him to get a resource back. He may sound dangerous at first, but there are some reliable tools to get rid of him in this Deck:\r\n\r\n•• [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) is an excellent way to do it, though there is no <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window between the Upkeep Phase when he readies until the moment when you can use [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) so you cannot use him before discarding him this way.\r\n\r\n•• With [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058), get rid of him while generating a resource. The <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> ability can be used during the Upkeep Phase to prevent him from advancing the Agenda, but not between the moment when [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) and [David Renfield](/card/03112) are [readied during the Upkeep Phase](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Appendix_II_Timing_and_Gameplay) and the moment when the Doom is added to the Agenda.\r\n\r\n•• Trigger Attacks of Opportunity or engage an enemy that will attack you during the Enemy Phase.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) is of course here to reduce the cost of your expensive [Investigation](/card/01689) [Spells](/card/08101). It is a way of having <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> 3 resources.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [\"Watch this!\"](/card/03233) is great here because it commits to your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> on your _Spells_ and brings you again <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> 3 resources.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n[Cheat the System](/card/08050) can bring up to 4 resources but will often only bring 3, which is the last way to get resources <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n[Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) that gives you 4 resources for 1 action, and the Horror can be leveraged to get rid of [David Renfield](/card/03112), soaked by [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151) or simply by your 9 Sanity.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) is a great way to make sure that [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151) is online without impacting your game much. It is also super helpful at the beginning of a scenario to set up some of your expensive cards since you know that a lot of cash will come afterwards, mainly thanks to the <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> colour that boosts your [Cheat the System](/card/08050).\r\n\r\n**Use these resources to your advantage:**\r\n\r\n• Pay for your high number of expensive Assets, of course.\r\n\r\n• [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151) of course that is here only for his static boosts: <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for our [Investigation](/card/01689) [Spells](/card/08101) and <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> for the [Lockpicks](/card/01687) and the many Parley actions. His <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> ability is irrelevant here.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113)'s requirement to not be exiled is aligned with Dario, forcing you to at least finish the scenario with 10 resources.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• Use the extra resources to boost critical tests using [Moxie (3)](/card/08056)\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:green;\"> **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n**Level 0 Cards:**\r\n\r\n• We choose [St. Hubert's Key](/card/03269) over [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) for multiple reasons:\r\n\r\n•• You have 9 Sanity, so the -2 is not so impactful. In case you would go insane, the heal is helpful.\r\n\r\n•• You have the resource generation power to afford it\r\n\r\n•• The <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is useful for your [Lockpicks](/card/01687) and Scenario Tests such as Parley.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Cheap Shot](/card/03194) is ok at first to deal with [Acolytes](/card/01169) and [Swarm of Rats](/card/01159) but are quickly upgraded out.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) is dangerous, but hell, it's fun. Going insane IG and IRL for 1 victory point will bring you some of your best memories of this game (after a short grieving period). Plus, everyone will be grateful when you make it work once everyone has already resigned and you stay behind!\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) is good when you are in a cul-de-sac and want to move to another place with clues or dash through a location with an enemy. It also commits for 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> which is great for emergency Evade actions.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) to boost your Spells, [Perception](/card/01090) for your [Lockpicks](/card/01687) and [Quick Thinking](/card/02229) for when you need a little bit more time.\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Level 1-5 Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Moxie (3)](/card/08056) boosts your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for the tests and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for Evading and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) investigations. Plus it is free and fast, so you're always happy when you draw it.\r\n\r\n•• When it brings you good protection for damage, which is one of Sefina's main weaknesses, it only has 1 Sanity, and therefore you will be limited in your use of [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) if you don't want to lose it. [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151) and [David Renfield](/card/03112) help compensating.\r\n\r\n`Warning:` You cannot commit <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> cards to the [Lockpicks](/card/01687), but nothing prevents you from boosting your <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> with [Moxie](/card/08056) to boost your tests with the [Lockpicks](/card/01687).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Black Market](/card/08055) can be used in multiple ways:\r\n\r\n•• Just before you draw a weakness that you spotted with [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066), access the cards under it and reshuffle your Deck afterwards, hopefully burying your weakness.\r\n\r\n•• When [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066) revealed an interesting combo, like [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) + [Cheat the System](/card/08050) + [Dario El-Amin](/card/03151).\r\n\r\n•• To find [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) to play a Spell from your hand at a lower cost.\r\n\r\n•• To find [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) and [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) to kill [David Renfield](/card/03112).\r\n\r\n•• To dig for [The Painted World](/card/03012).\r\n\r\n_You may ask why there is only 1 copy, though? While playtesting, knowing the cards to come was often enough, and I rarely found that it was the moment to play [Black Market](/card/08055) since when doing so, it often means that I will spend my whole turn playing the cards in it which can impact my tempo significantly. You can always opt for a second copy if you like it a lot._\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Ace in the Hole](/card/02266) is the cherry on the cake. Draw it with [Black Market](/card/08055) to get the most uses of the Market Cards. It is particularly exciting in Sefina as it feels frustrating to Draw a card under her and play it immediately, costing 2 actions. It feels really slow when it happens, so having 3 more actions can compensate for that feeling.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:green;\"> **What cards should I put under Sefina?**\r\n\r\nIf possible, the amazing cards to place under [Sefina Rousseau](/card/03003) are in order: \r\n\r\n1. **[Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066)**\r\n1. [Winds of Power](/card/08063) \r\n1. [Black Market](/card/08055)\r\n1. [Ward of Protection (0)](/card/01065)\r\n1. [Cheat the System](/card/08050)\r\n1. [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) \r\n1.

Better to use the charges 1 by 1 and use [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) as your last action for 2-clues.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Perception](/card/01090) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Lockpicks](/card/01687) x2 - 2xp - Total 4xp\r\n\r\n•• The [Lockpicks](/card/01687) allow you to investigate with a base 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, which is way early in the campaign to allow you to not use [Perception](/card/01090).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Flashlight](/card/01087) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Parallel Fates (2)](/card/08066) x2 - 4xp - Total 8xp\r\n\r\n•• With [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689), [Divination](/card/08101) and [Lockpicks](/card/01687) and your big starting hand, you do not need the [Flashlight](/card/01087) anymore, especially as [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) helps you digging in your Deck for the cards you need.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Cheap Shot](/card/03194) x1 + [Scout Ahead](/card/08047) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Foresight](/card/08064) x2 - 2xp - Total 10xp\r\n\r\n•• Now that you can look inside your Deck with [Parallel Fates](/card/08066), you will want to place [Foresight](/card/08064) right before your weakness to discard it easily.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Unscrupulous Loan](/card/08113) x1 - 3xp - Total 13xp\r\n\r\n•• Helps tremendously with your set-up and makes [Dario](/card/03151)'s boost easily accessible.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Moxie (3)](/card/08056) x2 - 6xp - Total 19xp\r\n\r\n•• Static boosts, Health Soak and a fantastic way to spend your resources. Also, the [Lockpicks](/card/01687) are happy to have a little boost. We replace [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) because these 2 cards are incompatible since the low sanity of [Moxie (3)](/card/08056) would make [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) unusable.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Winds of Power](/card/08063) - 2xp - Total 21xp\r\n\r\n•• At this point of the campaign, drawing enemies starts to be scary, and you cannot cancel them with [Ward of Protection](/card/03270).

I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.\"_\r\n\r\n**The 5 Elements Archmage:**\r\n\r\nThis Deck masters all 5 elements: <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span><span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) turns into [Divination (4)](/card/08103) and [Shrivelling](/card/01060) into [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092). This is the best build for True Solo.\r\n\r\n•• With these 2 cards, The <span style=\"color:green;\">Green [Red Clock](/card/08053)  <span style=\"color:black;\"> and [Prophetic](/card/08120), you have the 5 elements available for [Close the Circle](/card/08062) that comes in play with 6 additional actions and [Call for Backup](/card/08129) to heal your teammates, and gain tempo over the Mythos.\r\n\r\n•• You can use the charge on [Close the Circle](/card/08062) during any player window, which includes evading a _Hunter_ enemy just after it moves to your location and engages you. Also, remember that you do not need to use your <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> during this action, you can simply move. This additional action is subject to Attacks of Opportunity though.\r\n\r\n•• We prefer the [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) as it still boosts your synergy cards even if [Prophetic](/card/08120) is buried deep, it is cheaper to reload with [Spirit-Speaker](/card/03014) and less damaging to lose charges because of [Angered Spirits](/card/03015). To balance out the negative aspect, [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) can take care of the first actions, especially thanks to the boost of [The Red Clock](/card/08053) for your first Test, and then use [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) for the finish.\r\n\r\n•• Thanks to your built-in [Reload Engine](/card/03014), this Deck is extremely versatile and will make both <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> jealous because you'll be better at their job than them combined.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**The full offensive Battlemage:**\r\n\r\n• You upgrade to [Shrivelling (5)](/card/02306) and [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) into [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092). With the [Dragon Pole](/card/08060), you have enough to easily be the boss-killer of your group.\r\n\r\n•• Both [Shrivelling (5)](/card/02306) and the [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) can deal 3 damages reliably. It is good to alternate their uses to decrease the risk: prefer the Brand at the end of your turn and [Shrivelling](/card/02306) if you still have good sanity. To save Charges and finish off enemies with 2hp, you always have your [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) and 1 damage can always be done <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> with [Close the Circle](/card/08062).\r\n\r\n•• This leads you to anywhere between 7 and 10 damage per turn.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n** The [Divination](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney#Job_application) Master:**\r\n\r\n• [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) upgrades in [Rite of Seeking (4)](/card/02233) and [Shrivelling](/card/01060) into [Divination (4)](/card/08103). \r\n\r\n•• This Deck is a monster clue-getter, while still being autonomous thanks to [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) that allow [Akachi Onyele](/card/03004) to still deal with the smaller enemies she would draw.\r\n\r\n•• Albeit being significantly more expensive, [Prophetic](/card/08120), [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) and [The Red Clock](/card/08053) are generating enough resources to pay for it all.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n[![Torrent-Of-Power.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RVWRFShM/Torrent-Of-Power.png)](https://postimg.cc/CzVDrVbt)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple;\">  **Every Mage has a Staff:**\r\n\r\nThe [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) can be put to good use in [Akachi Onyele](/card/03004) not only for the extra _Arcane_ Slot, but since she has 3 base <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> she can fight up to 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with 3 spells on the table. On top of this, we also have multiple ways to bring this score much higher:\r\n\r\n• [Overpower](/card/01091), [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) obviously.\r\n\r\n• [The Red Clock](/card/08053) can bring you +3 to your first attack if you time it correctly. Unfortunately, the lvl 2 is a bit clunky, forcing you to first collect the resources and only the turn after you can get the +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n•• Note that this +3 is not bound to time, so it stays until you pass a test and even stacks if you happen to do the first thick twice without any test in between.\r\n\r\n•  [Torrent of Power](/card/03235) can be used to boost any _Spell_ as well as your [Mage Staff](/card/08060). The potential targets are [Alchemical Transmutation](/card/03032), [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) (better to use one of its charges to deal 2 damage), [Close the Circle](/card/08062) or even the [The Red Clock](/card/08053) to bring it back to 0 and benefit from +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> at the beginning of the next turn or bring it back to 2 to get another additional action next turn!\r\n\r\n• [Blood Pact](/card/02191) that you can use either if you have [Moonlight Ritual](/card/02267) in your hand and more than 4 Doom to go or during the last Round of the Agenda for +3 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> at each test you perform (could be 4 fight actions if you timed the [The Red Clock](/card/08053) correctly).\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple;\">  **Speaking to the Spirits:**\r\n\r\nWhat makes [Akachi Onyele](/card/03004) so potent is her Signature: [Spirit-Speaker](/card/03014). It doesn't sound strong but trust me, it is addictive.\r\n\r\n• Use it to recharge any of your _Spells_ using 1 action and its cost. The cost is absorbed by [Prophetic](/card/08120), [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) or your resources and the action is fine since _Spells_ come with a great built-in action acceleration. Emptied your [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092)? How about reloading it completely for 2 resources and 1 action? This is such an increase to the value of your high XP Spells.\r\n\r\n• Join the Dark Side of the Force and make $$$. You are unlikely to use this ability of your Signature, but it can save your soul for instance by using the last charges of any _Spell_ to pay for [Storm of Spirits](/card/03153). Once you have [Spirit-Speaker](/card/03014), [Alchemical Transmutation](/card/03032) turns into an [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) that commits for a <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> if you don't need it. [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) brings you 10 resources for a starting cost of 2, so 8 net profit. Sorry [Hot Streak](/card/01057) but you're not #1 anymore.\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple;\">  **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n** Level 0 Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) fits perfectly here to absorb the damage from [Shrivelling](/card/01060) while also boosting your main stat: <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) that you can play either before the Agenda advances or that you clean with [Moonlight Ritual](/card/02267) (which is a _Spell_ so it can be found by the Initiate) helps you to tutor your most important cards.\r\n\r\n•• Once you have [Charisma](/card/01694), you can have both [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) on the table at the same time since she's not unique. Congratulations, you are now the teacher of a School of Magic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111), because everyone loves XP, so if you can bring more to your party, why wouldn't you. Plus you are naturally talented at dealing with the Encounter Deck.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Moonlight Ritual](/card/02267) as said before to clean the [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) and [Blood Pact](/card/02191).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Storm of Spirits](/card/03153) is also a nice fighting _Spell_ that is terrific when there are more than 2 enemies at your location. The higher the player count the better. The hefty cost is covered by [Prophetic](/card/08120).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) of course to prevent [Ancient Evils](/card/01166) from ruining your well-prepared plans.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n** Level 1-5 Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Close the Circle](/card/08062) is a powerhouse in this Deck to pass any Scenario Tests like Parleys, Tests on locations, treachery cards, anything. For 1 Action to play it, you gain 5 net actions out of it. And what's best? You can refill it at will.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Prophetic](/card/08120) is obvious in this Deck: either pay for the _Spells_ directly or boost your hard test. Why would you lose 2 actions with [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) if you could instead boost yourself up high enough to not take any risk?\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [The Red Clock (2)](/card/08053) is fun and brings a bit of variety to the often linear Mystic gameplay, introducing a _chess-like_ feeling to the game. You now have to think ahead, when will I need resources, a bonus on my [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) or <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, will there be a time when I will need to move across the map, how about an extra action to refill an empty _Spell_? No matter what you get, it's always welcome.\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span>\r\n\r\n[![Carcosa-Akachi.png](https://i.postimg.cc/kg46mmNW/Carcosa-Akachi.png)](https://postimg.cc/w7CTXnGB)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:rebeccapurple;\">  **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\nFor this upgrade path, I will focus on the Synergy build that is to me the most optimised one:\r\n\r\n• [Alchemical Transmutation](/card/03032) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Brand of Cthugha (1)](/card/08090) x2 - 2xp - Total 2xp\r\n\r\n•• More combat _Spells_, and more charges to spend for other uses.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guts](/card/01089) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Prophetic](/card/08120) x2 - 6xp - Total 8xp\r\n\r\n•• Pay for your _Spells_ and get a welcome boost for them.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [The Red Clock (2)](/card/08053) x1 + [Relic Hunter](/card/01695) x1 - 7xp - Total 15xp\r\n\r\n•• Offers a nice boost especially for your [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) when you have 1 charge and some resources, as well as a <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Asset.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Divination (1)](/card/08101) x2 - 2xp - Total 17xp\r\n\r\n•• Cheaper, more flexible _Spell_ that offers a little <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost and a <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Asset.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Shrivelling](/card/01060) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Close the Circle](/card/08062) x2 - 2xp - Total 19xp\r\n\r\n•• By this time, you have Assets from every class, guaranteeing you an amazing use of [Close the Circle](/card/08062), especially for Scenario Tests.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span>  [Call for Backup](/card/08129) x2 - 4xp - Total 23xp\r\n\r\n•• Since you now have the 5 elements represented in your Deck, this card can really bring wicked value to your team.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Brand of Cthugha](/card/08090) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Brand of Cthugha (4)](/card/08092) x2 - 6xp - Total 29xp\r\n\r\n•• Fight bigger enemies faster, with a greater <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost and more charges.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Blood Pact](/card/02191) x1 - 3xp - Total 32xp\r\n\r\nNow that enemies tend to be beefier, the <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> test really helps the [Dragon Pole](/card/08060).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Divination (1)](/card/08101) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Divination (4)](/card/08103) x2 - 6xp - Total 38xp\r\n\r\n•• More clues for the same price.

I decided to go this way to mitigate the negative impact of [Angered Spirits](/card/03015), to leverage the _Synergy_ allowed by the Deck, and simply because it already performs above expectations like this. You are free to try to upgrade the Deck using [Shrivelling (5)](/card/02306) and [Divination (4)](/card/08103) for roughly similar results or even choose [Rite of Seeking (4)](/card/02233).\r\n___\r\n\r\nIf you have access to [Jacqueline Fine](/card/60401), the only real change I would do is to replace [Rite of Seeking](/card/01689) with [Clairvoyance](/card/60408) and maybe add [Fearless](/card/01067).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIf you are playing this Deck with the others of the series and only 1 collection, here is a proposed way to distribute the overlapping cards for each investigator:\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Mythos Busting Mark|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217632) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217674)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Scavenge-Minhg|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217633) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217719)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Sefine-Art Black Magic Painter|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217635) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217724)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Akachi Ony-Elemental Mage|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217631) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217716)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Yorick Gold Digger|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217634) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217723)  \r\n___\r\n\r\n• If you do not mind proxying a few cards, the ones that could definitely bring added value to this Deck are:\r\n\r\n•• [Sign Magick (3)](/card/54008) instead of [Dragon Pole](/card/08060) at one point of the campaign for acceleration.\r\n\r\n•• [Wish Eater](/card/06277) instead of the last [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) standing for getting advantage of the enemies you heal.",

If you are not familiar with it, it doesn't seem that good at first, but if you try, you will understand why it is often one of the strongest gimmicks in many games. While being considered one of the most appreciated investigators by the community, Yorick is a terrific enemy manager, and his playstyle is extraordinarily satisfying and dynamic.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAfter the warm welcome of the Beginner Decks made for [Zoey](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36478/bruiz-oey-monster-cook-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), [Rex](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36402/clue-vacuuming-rex-revised-eote-tdl-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), [Jenny](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36548/mojenny-rules-the-world-revised-eote-tdl-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), [Jim](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36513/true-ma-jim-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0) and [Pete](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/36538/pete-the-underdog-revised-tdl-eote-beginner-deck-guide-1.0), I decided to go for a last Series of Beginner Deck Guides for The Path to Carcosa.\r\n\r\nFind the other Carcosa Beginner Decks:\r\n\r\n• <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [Mythos Busting Mark](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37361/mythos-busting-mark-beginner-deck-guide-series-1.0)  \r\n• <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [Scavenge-Minhg](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37360/scavenge-minhg-beginner-deck-guide-series-1.0)  \r\n• <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [Sefine-Art Black Magic Painter](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37359/sefine-art-black-magic-painter-beginner-deck-guide-series-1.0)  \r\n• <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [Akachi Ony-Elemental Mage](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/37358/akachi-ony-elemental-mage-beginner-deck-guide-series-1.0)    \r\n• I decided not to propose a Deck for [Lola Hayes](/card/03006) on purpose as even with the help of the community, we couldn't find any Deck that made us feel like you wouldn't regret playing any other investigator instead. If she piqued your curiosity, keep her in a corner of your mind until you have a bit more cards.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Table of Contents:**\r\n\r\n• Overview\r\n\r\n• Main Strategy\r\n\r\n• Dealing with enemies\r\n\r\n• Playing the Discard Pile as a second Deck\r\n\r\n• Supporting your teammates\r\n\r\n• Other Cards\r\n\r\n• Upgrade Path\r\n\r\n• Make your own Deck!\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Overview:**\r\n  \r\n||&nbsp;||\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n|Difficulty:||★★★☆☆|\r\n|Enemy Management:||★★★★☆|\r\n|Clue-getting:||★☆☆☆☆|\r\n|Encounter protection:||★★★☆☆|\r\n|Survivability:||★★★★☆|\r\n|Economy:||★★★☆☆|\r\n|Card Drawing:||★★☆☆☆|\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\">**Main Strategy:**\r\n\r\n• Maintain your [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) by ignoring <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> tokens with [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) and <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> with [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692).\r\n\r\n• Dig Assets in your Discard Pile from turn 1 with [Short Supply](/card/08071).\r\n\r\n• Help your teammates pay for their _Items_ and with damage.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Dealing with enemies:**\r\n\r\n[William Yorick](/card/03005) can be [used in True Solo](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/28743/expert-true-solo-william-0xp-does-it-all-deck-guide-1.0) but is mainly played as the main fighter of the group.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) is your primary weapon early in the campaign.\r\n\r\n•• It provides a steady source of 2-damage attacks and gives you +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\n•• The reason why this weapon is not considered amazing is because it usually breaks exactly when you need it most, leaving you naked. To prevent this from happening, we pack [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) that you use to ignore the <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>. You can use it to cancel a <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> token, ignore it, discard [Heavy Furs](/card/08126), draw a new token, succeed and Play it immediately from your Discard Pile.\r\n\r\n•• You will never see as many <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> as when you play this build. We quickly buy [Eucatastrophe](/card/05324) to turn this frustration into an opportunity with [William Yorick](/card/03005)'s wicked <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>.\r\n\r\n_Note that the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) still completes the attack if you pull _<span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> _or_ <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>_, so it can still kill an enemy and reward you with a card from your Discard Pile. On the other hand, you can **not** play the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) that was just discarded on the same attack in case you succeed._\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Knife](/card/01086) is here in case you do not find the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) during your Mulligan or if it is in your Discard Pile thanks to [Short Supply](/card/08071) and is perfect to kill 1 enemy to access it. There are more explanations in the _Playing the Discard Pile as a second Deck_ section.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• Later in the game, when you have [Beat Cop](/card/01018) to boost your <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, you can purchase the [Fire Extinguisher](/card/02114) to decrease the risk of failing at a crucial moment and sending Yorick straight to where he loves hanging. It also frees a hand slot for the convenient [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) that can increase your damage output.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n[![Yorick.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/43qGwVb0/Yorick.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/p9f3L9SQ)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Playing the Discard Pile as a second Deck:**\r\n\r\n_\"You see trash? I see gold. You see junk? I see poetry.\"_ \r\n\r\n[William Yorick](/card/03005) is the Discard Pile Recursion gimmick archetype in Arkham Horror. \r\n\r\n** Enable your Discard Pile:**\r\n\r\n• [Short Supply](/card/08071) discards 10 cards at the beginning of each game. \"Why would I do that?\" You may ask. [William Yorick](/card/03005)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> is what makes him so strong, yet it is useless if there is no Asset in your Discard Pile. [Short Supply](/card/08071) conveniently stuffs it for you, giving your quick access to interesting Assets even if you draw an enemy during the 1st Mythos Phase.\r\n\r\n•• During the mulligan, your targets are: [Baseball Bat](/card/01074), [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) and [Knife](/card/01086). So hopefully, there is one of these cards in your hand before [Short Supply](/card/08071) is activated. Otherwise, you wish that there is one in your discard pile, and if not, it means that power drawing for a few turns should give one to you rather fast as there are not so many cards left in your Deck.\r\n___\r\n• [William Yorick](/card/03005)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> allows you to play Assets from your Discard Pile, making them <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>. If you have no interesting Asset in your Discard Pile, you can commit one from your hand to a test to play it as soon as you defeat an enemy.\r\n\r\n**Dig up:**\r\n\r\n• The order in which you would like to Play Assets from your discard pile depends on your funds, yet we can make an order:\r\n\r\n1. [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) of course, as your primary weapon\r\n1. [Schoffner's Catalogue](/card/08072) is essential to pay for your many items\r\n1. [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) to secure your [Baseball Bat](/card/01074).\r\n1. [Guard Dog](/card/01021) or [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028)\r\n1. [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114) or [Plucky (3)](/card/08081)\r\n1. [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107)\r\n1. [Bandages](/card/08073)\r\n___\r\n• The reason why we added [Knife](/card/01086) in this Deck is that it is an excellent one-off enemy killer that enables you to use your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to play your [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) that has good chances to be in your discard pile before your first turn thanks to [Short Supply](/card/08071). It is cheap and able to deal 2 damage quite reliably. It is then replaced by [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) that is <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> and can fill the same role though it exhausts, so you can only use it for one attack.\r\n\r\n•• Other options were the [Fire Axe](/card/02032), but that would eat the resources necessary to pay the Bat once you killed the enemy. Every other weapon that can deal 2 damage such as [.45 Automatic](/card/01016), [Machete](/card/01020), [Sledgehammer](/card/08094) are 3 resource or more, which would be too expensive.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• To summarise which Asset digging is legal or not, here we go:\r\n\r\n•• Defeat [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) to cancel a <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>, kill an enemy and dig it. YES\r\n\r\n•• Kill [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) to defeat an enemy and dig it: YES\r\n\r\n•• Pull a <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> token that breaks your [Baseball Bat](/card/01074), still kill the enemy with that attack, and bring the just broken bat back: NO\r\n\r\n•• Trigger an AoO ([Attack of Opportunity](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Attack_of_Opportunity)) on an enemy, discard [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114)/[Plucky (3)](/card/08081) because of the horror, and take the damage on the [Guard Dog](/card/01021), generating one damage that would kill the enemy that made the AoO. Use [William Yorick](/card/03005)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to bring back the [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114)/[Plucky (3)](/card/08081) discarded during the AoO: YES\r\n\r\n•• Kill the [Guard Dog](/card/01021) while dealing a damage to the enemy that would defeat it, and play the [Guard Dog](/card/01021) just defeated: YES\r\n\r\n•• Use [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) to deal +1 damage by discarding it, kill the enemy and replay it immediately: YES\r\n\r\n•• Committing a card like the [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) for its <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> icon to an Attack, succeed and Play that card immediately: NO (the cards committed are discarded at the very end of the test).\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Supporting your teammates:**\r\n\r\nThe last part that is nice with [William Yorick](/card/03005), as with most <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>, is that he can help his teammates.\r\n\r\n• [Schoffner's Catalogue](/card/08072) can help others set up their expensive Items. And if it is empty, you can recur it anyways.\r\n\r\n• [Bandages](/card/08073) can help your more fragile teammates such as [Sefina Rousseau](/card/03003).\r\n\r\n• While most of your Assets commit for <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, which is more your role, some others can help other Investigators to find clues or pass scenario tests while enabling you to Play them <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> from your discard pile later.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Plucky.png](https://i.postimg.cc/xd5H5h8x/Plucky.png)](https://postimg.cc/R33NVPcK)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n**Cards level 0:**\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) to help you if you need a little extra cash. It is upgraded later to [Emergency Cache (3)](/card/03239) as the Supplies can be added to [Bandages](/card/08073) if you do not need any resource, which grants you more uses of [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028).\r\n___\r\n• [Lucky!](/card/01080) is a reactive [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), especially good defensively during tests on Treachery cards.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [On the Hunt](/card/03263) is good to draw more Enemies that you can use in quiet moments and in case you need to bring back a necessary card, especially a defensive one such as [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114)/[Plucky (3)](/card/08081)\r\n___\r\n• [Prepared for the Worst](/card/02184) is always dull but necessary.\r\n___\r\n• [Resourceful](/card/03039) is especially good since you have [Short Supply](/card/08071) and later on you will have more <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> cards that are not Assets.\r\n___\r\n• [Overpower](/card/01091) and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to land more attacks and deal with 3 Health. \r\n___\r\n• [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) mostly for defensive reasons.\r\n___\r\n**Cards level 1-5:**\r\n\r\n• [Eucatastrophe](/card/05324) is good since [William Yorick](/card/03005) has one of the greatest <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, and what's better than more of them? It is especially terrific as a <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> cancelling tool.\r\n___\r\n• [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) is not the best here, but it is still +3 <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> and up to +4 <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> with [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107), which should allow you to pass any test.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n[![Carcosa-William.png](https://i.postimg.cc/90YhS6RS/Carcosa-William.png)](https://postimg.cc/Lg5wg0VB)\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the full xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2062845)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692) x2 - 6xp - Total 6xp\r\n\r\n•• Prevent yourself from the <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> that would discard your [Baseball Bat](/card/01074).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Guard Dog](/card/01021) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) x2 - 4xp - Total 10xp\r\n\r\n•• From here, you can abuse the auto damage from the [Beat Cop](/card/01028) and refill it with [Bandages](/card/08073).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Charisma](/card/01694) x1 - 3xp - Total 13xp\r\n\r\n•• Helps you have 2 [Beat Cops](/card/01028) online at the same time for 2 testless damage that you can heal simultaneously if you have 2 [Bandages](/card/08073) at the same time.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n[Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Plucky (3)](/card/08081) x2 - 6xp - Total 19xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Fire Extinguisher (3)](/card/08080) x2 - 6xp - Total 25xp\r\n\r\n•• After a while, the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) becomes a bit too clunky as you need to fight bigger enemies, and losing it becomes increasingly damaging.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Knife](/card/01086) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) x2 - 6xp - Total 31xp\r\n\r\n•• Now that you do not have the Bat anymore, the knives are less valuable.\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Heavy Furs](/card/08126) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077) x2 - 2xp - Total 33xp\r\n\r\n•• Now that you have the [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) and that the Scenario Tests are becoming hard to pass, the 3-4 <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> are excellent to have.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Emergency Cache (3)](/card/03239) x2 - 6xp - Total 39xp\r\n\r\n•• Get more $$$, draw a card and gain the luxury to assign the unnecessary resources to your [Bandages](/card/08073) for more testless damage.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Vicious Blow (2)](/card/02299) x2 - 4xp - Total 43xp\r\n\r\n•• More damage when you need it.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span>\r\n\r\n### <span style=\"font-family:papyrus; color:crimson;\"> **Make your own Deck!:**\r\n\r\n• I try to use the [Taboo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9FvPwjWN1Y) for my Decks, but it is definitely not mandatory. If you don't it can be great to use [Machete](/card/01020) + [Knife](/card/01086) + [Flashlight](/card/01087) or [Old Keyring](/card/60507). The first is your base weapon, and the second is if you have more than 1 enemy on you and the last is to support the investigation on lower shroud locations.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• My first thought while making a [William Yorick](/card/03005) Deck was [Dark Horse](/card/02234). I made [This Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2161392) (if you are curious, look at it, it comes with its own upgrade path!), but while playing it, it turned out a bit more boring. It uses the same weapon over the full course of a campaign and lacks upgrades if you do not have [Stella Clark](/card/60501) and [Nathaniel Cho](/card/60101)'s Decks. Even if you do, the upgrades are often slight improvements of the same card ([Overpower](/card/01091) <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Overpower](/card/60126), etc...). Eventually, the fact that I already used [Dark Horse](/card/02234) with [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005) led me to propose this more exotic Deck that adds a layer of tension over the Chaos Bag which I loved.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• By now it's the 4th [Ice Pick (3)](/card/08107) Deck that I've released, with [Rex Murphy](/card/02002), [\"Ashcan\" Pete](/card/02005) and [Minh Thi Phan](/card/03002). The reason for this is that this card is simply too good to not take with anyone that can grab them from their discard pile or cycle their Deck fast enough to see them regularly, especially with such a small collection. If you are tired of them, keep your [Knife](/card/01086), and you'll do fine.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• If you have access to [Stella Clark](/card/60501) and [Nathaniel Cho](/card/60101), I would change the Deck very little. [Glory](/card/60115) is great instead of [On the Hunt](/card/03263). [Lucky! (3)](/card/60528) and [Overpower (2)](/card/60126) are also good upgrades to increase the team support and the drawing power.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• If you have access to The Forgotten Age, you could also play [Aquinnah (3)](/card/01582) and [Kerosene](/card/04304) to reflect damages, [Daniela Reyes](/card/08001) style.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nInteresting cards if you do not mind proxying are:\r\n\r\n• The [Old Hunting Rifle](/card/04273) instead of upgrading to the [Fire Extinguisher (3)](/card/08080). The consequences of failure are less harsh than the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) and you still have some <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> mitigation anyway.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nIf you are playing this Deck with the others of the series and only 1 collection, here is a proposed way to distribute the overlapping cards for each investigator:\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> Mythos Busting Mark|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217632) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217674)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Scavenge-Minhg|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217633) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217719)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Sefine-Art Black Magic Painter|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217635) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217724)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> Akachi Ony-Elemental Mage|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217631) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217716)  \r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> Yorick Gold Digger|One Collection Variant: [0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217634) / [Full XP Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2217723)",

I also wanted to give a viable alternative to the [Big Hand Harvey](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/25827/prof-draw-cula-big-hand-harvey-guide-1.0), knowing that Harvey is the second least liked Investigator on ArkhamDB after [Marie Lambeau](/card/05006) (but she came at a weird spot).\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n#### **Table of Content:**\r\n\r\n• Overview\r\n\r\n• Main Strategy\r\n\r\n• Big Draw, <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> Play\r\n\r\n• Clue Acceleration\r\n\r\n• Manage Horror and Damage\r\n\r\n• Other Cards\r\n\r\n• Upgrade Path\r\n\r\n• Make your own Deck!\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Overview:**\r\n\r\nDifficulty: ★★★★☆\r\n\r\nEnemy Management: ★★☆☆☆\r\n\r\nClue-getting: ★★★★★\r\n\r\nEncounter protection: ★★☆☆☆\r\n\r\nSurvivability: ★★★☆☆\r\n\r\nEconomy: ★★★★☆\r\n\r\nCard Drawing: ★★★★★\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Main Strategy:**\r\n\r\nDraw a lot of cards each turn with [Cryptic Research](/card/01043), [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032), [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102), [Vault of Knowledge](/card/60202), your <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and [Perception](/card/01090).\r\n\r\nAbuse [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) to replace your empty _Assets_  <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> or call your meat shields for duty while getting a clue (or more with [Deduction](/card/01039)).\r\n\r\nAccelerate the pace with [Divination](/card/08103), [Deduction](/card/01039), [Working a Hunch](/card/01037), [Eon Chart](/card/08098) all bringing you more clues each turn.\r\n\r\nAbsorb the Damage of your [Curiosity](/card/05026) and the Horror of the Deck-Cycling with your _Allies_.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Big Draw, <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> play:**\r\n\r\n**Draw a lot of cards:**\r\n\r\nThis Deck is packed with Draw engines:\r\n\r\n• [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) has been a staple since day 1 for a good reason: 3 cards, fast and free, are definitely worth the 4xp. It draws you 10% of your Deck.\r\n\r\n• [Harvey](/card/60201)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and [Vault of Knowledge](/card/60202) should be triggered every single turn bringing you 2 cards.\r\n\r\n• [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) that you use to call for _Even_. Once [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030), [Vault of Knowledge](/card/60202), [Divination](/card/08101) and [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302) are on the table; you will hit 15 cards out of 24, so on average 3 cards. Knowing your Deck well, you can also call for _Odd_ if you are looking for a specific card such as [Mind over Matter](/card/01036). Weaknesses being neither Odd nor Even, you will always shuffle them back with this effect.\r\n\r\n• [Perception](/card/01090) x2 bring you an extra 2 cards and 4 when upgraded.\r\n\r\n• [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102) that you will be able to play more or less once a turn.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the drawing power per turn is between 15 and 23 cards out of 24 cards that are not in Play. In practice, you are reliably cycling your deck every other turn.\r\n\r\n**Playing <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>:**\r\n\r\nThe whole Deck aims at spending as few actions that are not directly generating clues.\r\n\r\n• [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) is <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Divination](/card/08101), [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032), [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302), [Medical Student](/card/08083) and [Vault of Knowledge](/card/60202) can be played via [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) so while getting a clue.\r\n\r\n• [Eon Chart](/card/08098) gives you 3 actions, including one the same turn as you play it, making it virtually fast.\r\n\r\n• [Cryptic Research](/card/01043), [Mind over Matter](/card/01036), [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102), [Shortcut](/card/02022) and [Working a Hunch](/card/01037) are all <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Cryptic Writings](/card/60215) are also fast as you are highly likely to draw them during your turn\r\n\r\n• [Call for Backup](/card/08129) gives you a _Move_, a _Clue_ and a Horror-Healing, making it at least 2 actions for the cost of 1 you would be doing anyway.\r\n\r\nSo, in theory, you should not be spending a single action setting up or playing an event that does not bring you clues as everything is either fast or a target for [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039).\r\n___\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Clue Acceleration:**\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of all the Draw, especially knowing that it forces you to see your Weaknesses more often? The answer is clue acceleration.\r\n\r\n• Drawing [Working a Hunch](/card/01037) and being able to play it roughly once a turn is an extra, testless deduction. \r\n\r\n• More draw means more [Deduction](/card/01039), meaning more clues for your investigation actions.\r\n\r\n• [Divination (4)](/card/08103) gives you up to 3 clues in one action and [Eon Chart](/card/08098) gives you 1 more investigation move per turn, making it virtually an additional clue each turn. These 2 are replaced <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> with [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) when empty.\r\n\r\n• Another version of this Deck uses [Art Student](/card/02149) instead of [Medical Student](/card/08083) so that for +2 difficulty during the test on [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039), I get an additional clue coming with some soak. (I was also excited to find a home for that Ally finally!)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Manage Horror and Damage:**\r\n\r\nCycling your Deck fast will mean taking _a lot_ of Damage and Horror.\r\n\r\n• Damage comes from [Thrice-Damned Curiosity](/card/60203), one of the highly punishing Personal Weaknesses out there, which is one of the reasons why Harvey is often the least praised investigator from the sets.\r\n\r\n•• Playing cards as you draw them will keep your Hand quite small. It will consist of [Mind over Matter](/card/01036), [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102), [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) waiting for a good target, and [Divination](/card/08103)/[Eon Chart](/card/08098) waiting for the previous one to be empty. With Encounter Cards, you will need to absorb around 3 damage each time you cycle your Deck.\r\n\r\n•• [Jeremiah Kirby](/card/08032) can take 2 damage, and so does [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302). [Medical Student](/card/08083) can take over if you are going low on Health and want to get back into the safe zone.\r\n\r\n•• The _worst_ case for your Weakness is when you are power-drawing to look for a specific enabler. For instance, you need to replace your [Divination](/card/08103), and you spend your 2 [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) at once to find the other copy, you want to use [Shortcut](/card/02022) to move instead of using one action, but the 2 copies are still in your Deck, etc... In this case, you may be surprised with 10+ cards. Nevertheless, you will typically still have enough soak online to absorb everything but 1 or 2 Damage.\r\n\r\n• Damage can come from <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> tests on Treachery Cards and enemies. You will not be able to protect yourself against Encounter Cards much except by using [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302) or [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227) to evade enemies. This should already cover the most dangerous cases, though.\r\n\r\n• Horror comes Cycling your Deck: shuffling your discard pile to reform your Deck costs 1 Horror. It is soaked by your high sanity as well as your Allies. From Experience, that was less of a trouble than the Damage and using the [Medical Student](/card/08083) later in the scenario for your Health will help your Sanity, too, anyways.\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Other Cards:**\r\n\r\n• [Arcane Enlightenment](/card/60205) is here for 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n•• As you have 2 Arcane Slots, and Spells do not discard when empty, you need to replace your empty [Divinations](/card/08103) to be able to cycle them. \r\n\r\n•• I chose [Arcane Enlightenment](/card/60205) also because it is \"Even\" (for [Kirby](/card/08032)) and because if it is not needed, it is one of the rare Assets that commits for a double icon, here <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.\r\n\r\n• [Dr. William T. Maleson](/card/02302) is here for the soak, and as a side note, he is the best Resource/Soak available for this while also helping you get rid of potentially nasty Treacheries.\r\n\r\n• [Cryptic Writings](/card/60215) instead of [Crack the Case](/card/05110) because of the limited card pool first of all, but it is also better here because it discards itself as you draw it, which decreases the risk taken with [Thrice-Damned Curiosity](/card/60203).\r\n\r\n• [Charisma](/card/01694) instead of [Miskatonic Archaeology Funding](/card/60232) because the latter prevents you from assigning more than 1 damage at a time coming from [Thrice-Damned Curiosity](/card/60203), which would send Harvey back underground, with no more [Unearth for the Ancient](/card/08039). \r\n\r\n• [Shortcut](/card/02022) because _Move_ actions are the biggest Tempo killer in high-speed <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> Decks.\r\n\r\n•• One of the latest options is [Hiking Boots](/card/08035), which brings you a little boost against Encounter Tests and, most importantly, free Moves too. It is cheaper than Taboo [Pathfinder](/card/02108) both in XP and resource and, therefore, easier to play with [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039).\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Upgrade Path:**\r\n\r\n[Link to the 0xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2035916)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Burning the Midnight Oil](/card/60214) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Unearth the Ancients (2)](/card/08039) x2 - 4xp - Total 4xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Preposterous Sketches](/card/02186) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) x2 - 8xp - Total 12xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Charisma](/card/01694) x1 - 3xp - Total 15xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Occult Invocation](/card/60217) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Divination (1)](/card/08101) x2 - 2xp - Total 17xp\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Eon Chart](/card/08098) x2 - 2xp - Total 19xp\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Painkillers](/card/02117) x1 + [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Protecting the Anirniq](/card/08102) x2 - 4xp - Total 23xp\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Divination (1)](/card/08103) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Divination (4)](/card/08103) x2 - 6xp - Total 29xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Eon Chart](/card/08098) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Eon Chart](/card/08100) x2 - 6xp - Total 35xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Perception](/card/01090) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Perception](/card/60228) x2 - 4xp - Total 39xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Deduction](/card/01039) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Deduction](/card/02150) x2 - 4xp - Total 43xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227) x2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Call for Backup](/card/08129) x2 - 4xp - Total 47xp\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n• [Working a Hunch](/card/01037) x1 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> [Hiking Boots](/card/08035) x1 - 1xp - Total 48xp\r\n___\r\n\r\n[Link to the 49xp Deck](https://arkhamdb.com/deck/view/2036132)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span>\r\n\r\n#### **Make your own Deck!:**\r\n\r\n• For a beefier Deck, you can pack 2 [Occult Invocation](/card/60217) and a 2nd copy of [Mind over Matter](/card/01036).",

The replacement to [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) is designed to protect 3+ mental trauma you may have at this point. **If you are still comfortable with your sanity**, you may remove [Take Heart](/card/04201) instead.\r\n\r\n## Got more XPs?\r\n\r\n(I typically don't include cards in Side Deck much past 29 XP, but I used this deck and did arrive at TFA Scenario 6 Standard with 34 XP.)\r\n\r\nYou can add 2x [Alter Fate (3)](/card/04313) in place of 2x [Take Heart](/card/04201). At late campaign you may want to tone down the draw if you are nearing danger zone and don't want to risk anymore [Voice of the Messenger](/card/04016) you would have avoided when not drawing excessively, so removing [Take Heart](/card/04201) make some sense. (And [Lucky! (2)](/card/01084) upgrade might not be a good idea since it adds the draw.)\r\n\r\nReplace 2x [Leather Coat](/card/01072) with 2x [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) is possible but it has cons of 2 resources, a number that meant quite a lot in this deck, it is up to you. \r\n\r\nYou can do something to 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) and 2x [Perception](/card/01090) if the upgrade is still beneficial to [Scavenging](/card/01073). Some example in bigger card pool : \r\n\r\n- **The Path to Carcosa** : [Newspaper (2)](/card/03313), same <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons as [Perception](/card/01090) and now can be [Scavenging](/card/01073) for more commit.\r\n- **Revised Core Set / The Circle Undone** : [Eucatastrophe](/card/01692). Since the icon is <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>, this is quite a safe replacement to [Perception](/card/01090) with new feature.\r\n- **The Dream-Eaters** : [Scavenging (2)](/card/06332) would be straightforward upgrade.\r\n- **Edge of the Earth** : [Plucky (3)](/card/08081) is an excellent soak that does not disrupt [On Your Own](/card/04236), with relevant boost for [Scavenging](/card/01073) and even matches Calvin's horror boost. Put it down to cover your 5/6 horror.\r\n- **The Scarlet Keys** : [Flashlight (3)](/card/09122) would allow Calvin to use either damage or horror side to do the job.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this deck is probably the most *chef's kiss* 2 packs deck I have made so far. Most of limited pack decks are naturally lacking in synergy due to lack of choices but TFA did give a lot of \"Calvin card\" that it is possible to make quite a tight deck. Lack of variety of boost assets is also often a problem in limited pack decks, but Calvin has his built-in way to get to 5 stats.\r\n\r\n[Old Hunting Rifle](/card/04273) added in this Investigator Expansion is very similar in style to [Baseball Bat](/card/01074). With 4 cards of the same kind in the deck, I would like to build a deck geared for 2 handed weapon with failing effect. (The rifle replaces starting [Knife](/card/01086), not the [Baseball Bat](/card/01074).)\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the risk, this deck uses the newly added [Against All Odds](/card/04202) to hand-pick a success, without getting the <span class=\"icon-skull\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>. [Live and Learn](/card/04200) can also let you go one last time even after the weapon became not functional. ([Baseball Bat](/card/01074) : Break, [Old Hunting Rifle](/card/04273) : Out of ammo / jam.) Though, don't [Live and Learn](/card/04200) on Retaliate enemies! (It's a budget [Lucky!](/card/01080) after all.)\r\n\r\nWhat would glue everything together is [On Your Own](/card/04236), which discounts [Against All Odds](/card/04202), [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079), and [Perseverance](/card/04111) to 0 cost.\r\n\r\nThe classic [Will to Survive](/card/01085) follows later to round out the deck, this card is not usable before you have [On Your Own](/card/04236) for discount in the deck. Trust me, you will not want save up 4 resources and spend them all to play it when [Perseverance](/card/04111) on hand meant \"2 resources = alive\". 0 resources when you are near death is very scary!\r\n\r\nTo perform [Scavenging](/card/01073), use 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) and 2x [Perception](/card/01090). You should not remove [Perception](/card/01090), otherwise you can only scavenge on 1-2 shroud even when you have max 5 horror. [Flashlight](/card/01087) is not enough as it does not allow scavenging **while** you are holding either [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) or [Old Hunting Rifle](/card/04273).\r\n\r\n2x [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) is also retained til the end so he get either 1 or 2 clues on failed [Scavenging](/card/01073) attempts depending on how hard you get the minus, and it is also good with [Take Heart](/card/04201) and [On Your Own](/card/04236).\r\n\r\n# Campaign tips\r\n\r\n[On Your Own](/card/04236) can also defend against treachery that rid you of resources, you will always have 2 kinda hidden resources at all times regardless.\r\n\r\n[On Your Own](/card/04236) + [Perseverance](/card/04111) is what warms your heart. Seriously, even when you have 5 5 5 5 stats and some combination of [Leather Coat](/card/01072) and [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) (partially used up?), you can get a -5 or <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> on fail-by treachery and suddenly dies, or got all your asset destroyed. But with [Perseverance](/card/04111), you can voluntarily put all those fail-by damage / horror on you instead of on the assets to get the defeat, and cancel them all out. Your soak assets stays as they were! Since [On Your Own](/card/04236) readies in Upkeep Phase, you are almost guaranteed to not get defeated by a random fail-by damage / horror treachery in the upcoming Mythos Phase if you have [Perseverance](/card/04111) ready.\r\n\r\nWhen you get <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> and have to decide whether to heal to take more, look at used up treachery and try to guess what's left, or looking at the special symbol token if taking that damage / horror would allow you to \"cover\" them or not, or looking at enemies whether the heal would allow you to take some hits and get your stats back where they were or not.\r\n\r\nFor example in my TFA run I have 2x <span class=\"icon-elder_thing\"></span> = -3 which cause 1 horror when failed, together with 2x more -3 in the bag. That's a lot of -3! It meant if I have 5 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, I can repeatedly investigate 2 shroud with no commit without worry. Since there is a 2 shroud location that needs picking clues up right now, I decided to take my horror to 5/6. Conversely, in TFA the token jumps from -3 to -5 with no -4 in between. If the boost would grant you +4 advantage over the test instead of +3, then it does not improve the odds.\r\n\r\nBeware of weird effects which **reduce health** (lowering maximum HP) because in that case and you are hovering at 5/6 health, not even [Perseverance](/card/04111) or [Until the End of Time](/card/04015) can prevent your defeat!\r\n\r\n# Will to Survive tips\r\n\r\nThis is your trump card when you have either [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) or [Old Hunting Rifle](/card/04273). Not only that they will not break, you know for sure you can burst the enemy down if you have the stat **equal** to enemy's. And these weapons gives high boost of +2 and +3. Most enemy goes up to 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\nIt is expensive, but it does have a useful <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon you can use to land a hit and survive sometimes.\r\n\r\nCalvin kinda have \"adjustable\" <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. That means for [Baseball Bat](/card/01074) (+2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>), you need 2 damages on Calvin to win against most things with [Will to Survive](/card/01085). At the point you bought [Will to Survive](/card/01085) in, I think you will have 2 physical trauma or more already.\r\n\r\nThat goes together that the fact that on the turn you wanna [Will to Survive](/card/01085), you don't want to Move. You want to test, test, test, win, win, win! \r\n\r\nTo do so, you may need your friend's help to bring the enemy to you (no friendly-fire risk since you know you win the test), or have to take some hits by moving to the enemy in the earlier turn. Especially vs. Elite that you want to surely remove 6 HP+ from it the next turn without touching the bag, this Move preparation maybe worth the gamble of having to withstand one more Mythos Phase.\r\n\r\nYou can use this intentional hit-taking to raise Calvin's stat to the required number before striking back with decisive [Will to Survive](/card/01085).\r\n\r\n# Other tips\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Perseverance**</span>](/card/04111) : It says \"up to\", so sometimes you can choose to take some of the damage / horror for your benefit as you are willing to risk it. This often let you lands at exactly 5/6 5/6 for the ultimate life-and-death showdown.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Take Heart**</span>](/card/04201) : It can also give stuff to other investigators as it says \"the performing investigator\". [Leo Anderson](/card/04001) in the same expansion would love the draws and the resources so his Ally keeps pouring in.\r\n\r\n# Other popular soak cards\r\n\r\nYou may have heard about [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114), [Peter Sylvestre](/card/02033), [Jessica Hyde](/card/06118), etc. that are popular for keeping Calvin alive. Those cards are **not** in Forgotten Age Investigator Expansion. \r\n\r\nYou may modify this deck to include them as you like if you have those expansions. But in this 2 Packs Deck Guide series, I wanted to prove that a functional Calvin deck could be made with minimum spending.\r\n\r\n(Other than [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), RCore also gives you [Aquinnah (3)](/card/01691) for same XP cost, or use [Yaotl](/card/04035) from Forgotten Age. But this deck is themed around [On Your Own](/card/04236), so [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095) is the only choice.)",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n**You have free 5 XP on your Parallel Back!** Use 4 XP to get going with the [Runic Axe](/card/09022) right from scenario 1.\r\n\r\n# Dealing with Concealed enemies\r\n\r\n- Use Roland's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to expose when you don't need the clue.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Evidence!**</span>](/card/01522) : Instant expose, just like Roland's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Working a Hunch**</span>](/card/01537) : Flip concealed mini-card immediately without care about shroud.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Map the Area**</span>](/card/09048) / <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Breach the Door**</span>](/card/09026) : After getting the shroud reduced, your entire team can farm on all the mini-cards there easier including one that might get added later. Note that Concealed rule says it starts spreading from the investigator who draws it, and you can sometimes control where the mini-cards get placed. Top-tier expose helpers so we are keeping all 4 copies. (Map also help you farming clues/exposes with Inscription of the Elders on the axe.)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Kicking the Hornet's Nest**</span>](/card/09068) : If you kicked a Concealed enemy, they spawned on you not in the shadow, since it is not a \"draw\" Concealed keyword does not matter. You kill it for <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to get a clue which can be turned into an expose, plus the card gets you a clue (and resources) which can also be turned into an expose. Very good card to expose a lot ASAP.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Runic Axe**</span>](/card/09022) : It has **Inscription of the Elders** which turns over-success into a clue, which you can turn into an expose instead. Use [Physical Training](/card/01017), [Overpower](/card/01091), or the Accuracy inscription to get there. Note that you don't have to defeat the enemy for it to activate, so sometimes **not** killing it in one hit might get you even more clues. (Use [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to adjust as needed.) Remember that [Map the Area](/card/09048) helps with this too.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Field Agent**</span>](/card/09033) •• / <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Beat Cop**</span>](/card/01528) •• : Instant expose when needed. The upgraded cop can do it 3 times! Stack up useful static boosts with [Charisma](/card/01694).\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Nature of the Beast**</span>](/card/09111) • : Use the automatic clue to expose a mini-card at **any** location. If you choose an enemy from the encounter deck, not only you can then go kill it for <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>, you can choose it to land on anyone. If that card is Concealed, you may plan for the mini-cards to land on [Breach the Door](/card/09026) / [Map the Area](/card/09048) locations.\r\n\r\n# Other cards\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Dynamite Blast**</span>](/card/01524) : This is not for exposing as you can expose only 1 card. It is for a certain encounter set with Aloof enemies in this campaign, without going too much into spoilers.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Guidance**</span>](/card/09053) • : Looking closely the icon is kinda [Guts](/card/01089), so it safely upgrade that card while adding some extra function. Roland can [Breach the Door](/card/09026) / [Map the Area](/card/09048) then give his action for those who can take advantage of reduced shroud better, for example.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01588) / [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01693) •• : To get his 4 cost Ally down and still using tons of 2 cost Event in this deck, Roland can't remove this card. (Even with [Kicking the Hornet's Nest](/card/09068) helping the econ.) Therefore they are even upgraded pretty early in the plan so you get both the resources and the card to expose things.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Charisma**</span>](/card/01694) ••• : Stack up all his non-unique Ally to get stacking static <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> / <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boosts.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Martyr's Vambrace**</span>](/card/09037) ••• : Gives him some good resistance to <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests. Can soak instead of Ally which you want to use for exposing. This also aids what you picked from [Nature of the Beast](/card/09111).",

Agnes has her <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to do the automatic expose, and this deck will also push her <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to be up to the job with [Pocket Multi Tool](/card/09099), which also helps [Summoned Servitor](/card/09080) doing the jaws.\r\n\r\n(There is an another 2 packs TSK tech deck using [Roland Banks](/card/01001) : [**TSK Campaign Tech Deck No. 1**](https://arkhamdb.com/decklist/view/42950).

In most cases you have better options than wasting these charges exposing mini-cards.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Pocket Multi Tool**</span>](/card/09099) : \r\n  - Signal Mirror adds ubiquitous skill value to either Agnes's normal <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Evade, [Onyx Pentacle](/card/09085) when using <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> with [Holy Rosary](/card/01059), or [Summoned Servitor](/card/09080) using <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Jaws that Snatch.\r\n  - Pry Bar takes on [Nature of the Beast](/card/09111) encounter draw. \r\n  - Detachable let others at the same location takes on [Nature of the Beast](/card/09111) encounter draw.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Summoned Servitor**</span>](/card/09080) : Safe expose. Extra action equals more exposing and you can make it do the job somewhere remote, not even having to engage the enemy that fell off the shadow.\r\n  - Jaws that Snatch gets <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> boost from [Pocket Multi Tool](/card/09099) : Signal Mirror.\r\n  - Claws that Catch adds the required different action for Dæmonic Influence. Also kills enemy that fell off the shadow.\r\n  - Dreaming Call clean up heavily doomed chalice / pentacle, or return [Forbidden Knowledge](/card/01058) to hand.\r\n  - Dæmonic Influence exposes 2 mini-cards with Claws that Catch + Jaws that Snatch.\r\n  - Can kill [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) by using her as a sacrifice.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Onyx Pentacle**</span>](/card/09085) : Safe expose. Exposed a mini-card remotely by adding doom. If it is correct enemy falls on that location and you do not need to fight it immediately. Gets a <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost from [Pocket Multi Tool](/card/09099) : Signal Mirror.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Forbidden Knowledge**</span>](/card/01558) : Cause horror counter to expose 1 mini-card.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Hallowed Chalice**</span>](/card/09084) : Recover for more horror play.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Fearless**</span>](/card/01567) : Recover for more horror play.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) : Cause horror counter to expose 1 mini-card. Bypass Revelation on [Nature of the Beast](/card/09111).\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Nature of the Beast**</span>](/card/09111) • : If you get a Revelation, combo with [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) to expose 2 mini-card.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ghastly Possession**</span>](/card/09090) • : Allow more aggressive doom play on [Hallowed Chalice](/card/09084) / [Onyx Pentacle](/card/09085). Searchable with [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063). Can replenish 2 charges on [Shrivelling](/card/01060).\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Sin-Eater**</span>](/card/09094) •••<span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> : Final upgrade to allow rapid use of [Onyx Pentacle](/card/09085) / [Hallowed Chalice](/card/09084). Expensive but it does not disrupt the deck's balance.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Lifeline**</span>](/card/09110) • : You can amass a lot of failed actions from [Summoned Servitor](/card/09080) : Dæmonic Influence. Can continue playing after [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) ends your turn.\r\n\r\n# True Solo Adjustments\r\n\r\nCards for this adjustment are included in the Side Deck.\r\n\r\n- Instead of \"Claws that Catch\" we are getting \"Eyes of Flame\".\r\n- Replace 2x [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) with 2x [Refine](/card/09121). Try finding [Refine](/card/09121) and [Summoned Servitor](/card/09080) in the 1st scenario and make the \"Eyes of Flame\" command appear to start investigating.\r\n- Replace 2x [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) with 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087).\r\n- Replace 2x [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) with 2x [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079).  It works with \"Eyes of Flame\" 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and your 2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, whichever you are aiming the fail range to land at.\r\n- Please play on **Easy**. Limited collection decks are already kinda rough on Standard in multiplayer. True Solo definitely needs adjustment down a notch.\r\n\r\nTrue solo upgrade plan after these adjustments looks like this :\r\n\r\n[//]: # (==================== TABLE START ====================)\r\n|

I would remove one more [Colt Vest Pocket](/card/04268) for an another [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095). This thing melts really fast on Finn.

If you have Carcosa Investigator Expansion, upgrading [Pickpocketing (2)](/card/03195) should be solid choice.\r\n\r\n# Splash\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Survival Instinct**</span>](/card/01581) : Don't underestimate this humble card. Potentially let you work for a lot of clues in an unlikely situation, since the Evade you use for this card is also free **and** you get a free Move to where you want to go get clues anyway. You will have 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to make this work. To play strategically, you may intentionally wait next to the work location and setup to end your turn. If you draws an enemy, your free Evade will propel you to the destination as well as exhausting the enemy.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Dumb Luck**</span>](/card/04034) : This can be used plan the enemy draw & free Evade sprint I mentioned above with the [Survival Instinct](/card/01081), but **Finn has to be the lead investigator** to draw that enemy you just put back on top. Finn would rather draw an enemy than some <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test, so basically this card utilize an enemy to postpone Finn's Mythos Phase draw for a round! (In addition to [\"You handle this one!\"](/card/04028).) It is also a [Lucky!](/card/01080)-like insurance when evading when the chaos bag is harsh, since you play after failing the test, so his unboosted 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> works even against 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Winging It**</span>](/card/04272) : 1 copy. Finn has the <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to succeed with just -1 difficulty helping. Ultimately this combo with [The Skeleton Key](/card/04270), since shroud 1 reduces to 0 then the only thing in your way of 2 clues is the <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>.\r\n\r\n# Fence : How it works\r\n\r\n[Fence](/card/04108) plays [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) and [Colt Vest Pocket](/card/04268) Fast. Fast weapons are useful because you are never caught off-guard without a weapon since you skips AoO, and you have more actions to unload the guns. (Though you have the free Evade as well.)\r\n\r\n[Colt Vest Pocket](/card/04268) in particular need [Fence](/card/04108) to work. You don't want to play this gun normally, move in, shoot once, and throw it away. You must be caught off-guard by a just-spawned enemy (intentionally) then [Fence](/card/04108) it down Fast skipping AoO, to be able to unload 3 consecutive shots.\r\n\r\nFinn has 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to continuously work on clues, hoarding [Fence](/card/04108)-able cards on hand never having to waste action playing them while they are not needed yet. For example, [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) does nothing without an enemy. Keep 2 resources and [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) right until you get an enemy allow you to use that 2 resources for something else that came up, or committing [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) in a pinch.\r\n\r\nIt saves action for Illicit card that you brought up with [Smuggled Goods](/card/04010) that you are aiming to play it next, like [Lockpicks](/card/01687). It also works with [Smuggled Goods](/card/04010) itself to make it Fast.\r\n\r\nIllicit Talent [Burglary](/card/01045) and [Pickpocketing](/card/01046) are left 1x both in the deck, which [Fence](/card/04108) can save action to set them up.  Finn has both <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and free Evade to gain advantage from both.\r\n\r\nIt improves [Pay Day](/card/04233). This card normally costs an action, likely your final action, and get paid. By adding Fast, you are now allowed to take all the actions you want (including from [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), [Borrowed Time](/card/04308)) and get paid using the <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window after your final action, before going to the next investigator's turn. (You don't get +1 resource for action you spent for [Pay Day](/card/04233), since Fast does not use the Play action.) Don't forget that your free Evade count as an action too.\r\n\r\n[Finn's Trusty .38](/card/04011) is already Fast, so it gets the special privilege of -1 cost. (Card which is not Fast cannot choose the -1 cost, it **must** became Fast.)\r\n\r\nYou can use [Fence](/card/04108) to play an another [Fence](/card/04108). With 2 [Fence](/card/04108), it is possible to apply Fast then apply the -1 cost next to the same card as a combo! (Or even -2 cost for [Finn's Trusty .38](/card/04011).)\r\n\r\n# Limited fighting\r\n\r\nFinn has limited fighting of up to around 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) and [Finn's Trusty .38](/card/04011). Since [Overpower](/card/01091) are all removed, the only thing that push this limit is 1x [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) in the deck.\r\n\r\nThough [Hatchet Man](/card/04155) is kind of [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) to Finn since you have free Evade, unlike [Vicious Blow](/card/01025), it does not help with accuracy when you are actually attacking it next. The effect also expires on your turn, you can't transfer the attack up to the next investigator. But you can commit it for your friend's Evade to get the attack up in their turn. If your team has an another 3+ <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> investigator it could make a good combo with [Hatchet Man](/card/04155). It is also good to amp up automatic damage like [Beat Cop](/card/01018).\r\n\r\nEven if you don't have any more \"main\" fighter in the deck, Finn can keep evading enemies with his free Evade. Since he can investigate just fine, you maybe able to win before you are overrun by more enemies. He has 2x [Survival Instinct](/card/01081) and 2x [Dumb Luck](/card/04034) to keep doing it.\r\n\r\nIf you know the scenario is walled by having to defeat high <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy, [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) and [Burglary](/card/01045) are valuable pair of Asset. This deck is not made to fight like a Guardian, but at least if the situation calls for, he could with some effort. Use [Pay Day](/card/04233) to fuel [Hard Knocks](/card/01049).\r\n\r\nThe final card that could land an unlikely hit for you is 1x [Sure Gamble](/card/01056). I add this at the end expecting high minus token in the bag around that point.\r\n\r\nWith extended fighting and you are running out of guns in the deck, remember that [Smuggled Goods](/card/04010) can also grab a gun from discard pile though [Smuggled Goods](/card/04010) will be gone for good.\r\n\r\n# Pay Day\r\n\r\n- Remember that if you perform free Evade that count as an action.\r\n- With [Fence](/card/04108) you don't have to dedicate your final action to play it and end your turn, you can just use <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> window after your final action.\r\n- [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), of course improves the payout.\r\n- [Smuggled Goods](/card/04010) is one way to make [Pay Day](/card/04233) appear at the right moment.\r\n- [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) can get you an action too, but likely need [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) or [Overpower](/card/01091) to get that +3 over success.\r\n\r\n# Dealing with 1 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**\"You handle this one!\"**</span>](/card/04028) : Find other friends to take the horror or something like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164). If you have scenario knowledge that Striking Fear set is in, mulligan for this card might be a good idea. You don't want a quick 3 horror out of nowhere.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Dumb Luck**</span>](/card/04034) : You be the lead investigator then you know it is the enemy you are getting on your draw, not some dumb <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Elder Sign Amulet**</span>](/card/01595) ••• : Added at 19 XP to use his Accessory slot. Boring but indispensable to virtually \"skip\" horror willpower tests for about 1-2 times.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Sure Gamble**</span>](/card/01556) ••• : One glimmer of hope for Finn to fix [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) that lands on him while he don't have [\"You handle this one!\"](/card/04028) is this card. I wish I can add an another copy inside 29 XP. (In fact you can if you don't upgrade [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), an another copy lands at exactly 29 XP.)\r\n\r\n# How to borrow time\r\n\r\nOf course, put [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) down!\r\n\r\nKeep forwarding clicks from [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) in anticipation to draw [Pay Day](/card/04233), then you can get massive payout. Note that clicking <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> is an action, so you even not need to stop forwarding clicks to use [Pay Day](/card/04233).\r\n\r\nYou can keep extra action from [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688) hitting low combat enemy in [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) for later.\r\n\r\nIf you are stuck with sticky treachery that makes you unproductive, with a healing condition of testing at the end of your turn or simply wait til the end of round, clicking [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) to forward your turn might be helpful.\r\n\r\nSince Finn has free Evade every turn, [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) sometimes let you organize actions in an attempt to use more of the \"future\" free Evade to handle multiple enemies. For example, if you have 2 engaged enemy (A and B), you use free Evade for A. Since B prevent you from resuming in getting clues and you would rather leave fighting for the fighter, you don't want to waste your \"real\" Evade too since the next turn you would get one more fore free, you click [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) 3 times and end your turn. The fighter kills B that is engaging with you. Enemy A came back ready and engage you. Now you use free Evade again on A for the fighter, and now you have 6 actions this turn for productive work!\r\n\r\nSame concept as Finn's free Evade, anything that exhausts like [Lockpicks (1)](/card/01687) works once per turn. If your location is so difficult nothing except [Lockpicks](/card/01687) can beat, you can use [Lockpicks](/card/01687) and clicks to end your turn. Keep doing this and when the location is finally finished, you will have all the \"waiting for [Lockpicks](/card/01687) actions\" gathered from the past ready for use!\r\n\r\nWith 3 clicks on [Borrowed Time](/card/04308) and [Fence](/card/04108), sometimes you can be a hero in combat. Adding Fast works wonder in the mess of fighting. I once achieved very efficient turn unloading all ammo from [.41 Derringer (2)](/card/01688), one of them gets an extra action, [Fence](/card/04108) [Finn's Trusty .38](/card/04011) into play, free Evade with [Hatchet Man](/card/04155) to add damage and activate +1 dmg on [Finn's Trusty .38](/card/04011), continue shooting with some [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) sprinkled in. It was so much fun!\r\n\r\n# No solo tag?\r\n\r\nI really wanted to say this deck is ready for true solo play : He can investigate, fight and evade. But! Without someone to use [\"You handle this one!\"](/card/04028) on, and it will be such long ride until you get to add that 1x [Elder Sign Amulet](/card/01095), I'm afraid the solo experience might be too swingy.\r\n\r\nYou can try your luck and hope not too many <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> tests lands on you, though! [Leo De Luca](/card/01048)'s built-in 2 sanity might be able to push the limit of horror you can take and you may need to lose him more often than in multiplayers. But nothing can save you from something like [Frozen in Fear](/card/01164) except [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) I added very late, maybe move that earlier in the plan? Make sure to replace multiplayer card [\"You handle this one!\"](/card/04028) with something else.\r\n\r\nIf you have The Path to Carcosa player cards, change some <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> splashes to <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) might be good idea. Don't remove any [Dumb Luck](/card/04034), it is a 2 cost ticket to free Mythos Phase since recurring enemy can get handled by your free Evade.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n☆ : Using [Shrewd Analysis](/card/04106), you use 3 XP for both copies but you must select the upgraded versions at random. If you got the damage version, good! If you got the horror healing version, it can help alleviating [Call of the Unknown](/card/04009) punishments.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nUse [Vantage Point](/card/04306) on where you are moving to that has no clue (often low shroud), so you can move some clues elsewhere (e.g. VP locations) here then use her <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to investigate it.\r\n\r\nIf enemy has alternate defeat condition as an ability on its card (often testing <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> all which she has), use [True Understanding](/card/04153) to grab some clues.\r\n\r\n[Truth from Fiction](/card/04152) is just more <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> commit before you get to 20 XP+ range where you get some Assets using secrets.\r\n\r\nNote that you have to buy [Ancient Stone (1)](/card/04022) going into 2nd scenario so you have more scenarios to identify it. It is best that you get 4 XP+ in the 1st scenario so you can also buy 1x [Ornate Bow](/card/04204). If you got just 3 XP, give up on the stone and buy just [Ornate Bow](/card/04204). (Can't be helped, but bow is very useful.)\r\n\r\nAfter reaching 2x [Ornate Bow](/card/04204), mulligan for [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) and put away all [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) back to deck. Hope that playing [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) gets the [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) on her. If you can do this, your hand can hold [Ancient Stone](/card/04022) / [Flashlight](/card/01087) / [Magnifying Glass](/card/01030) / [Pnakotic Manuscripts](/card/04307) instead and would become a fine flex Seeker.\r\n\r\nIf you got 5 resources to spare with [Backpack](/card/04037) + [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021), you can play [Backpack](/card/04037) first and intentionally not pick the [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) to improve the concentration of the bow when you play Elli next.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading both [Ancient Stone (1)](/card/04022) for 3 XP with [Shrewd Analysis](/card/04106). We then use 8 XP to add 2x [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) that can fast draw 3 cards to combo with the stones.\r\n\r\nThe next \"stones\" to get are 2x [Pnakotic Manuscripts](/card/04307) for 10 XP (!). It is a better target for [Truth from Fiction](/card/04152) than the [Ancient Stone](/card/04022), as well as an another \"hit\" with [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) even if you didn't get the [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) as normal play cost is a hefty 5. Dead [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) can take it to discard pile so you can play a 2nd copy without hitting Unique constraint.\r\n\r\nBefore using [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) on yourself, ask your fighter if they need to find something or need more cards on hand or not.\r\n\r\nThe timing which [Thermos](/card/04274) slowly goes out of the deck is around mid to late scenario, which I guess someone might got to 2 trauma around this point.\r\n\r\nUrsula has 3 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> and 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> which often means using <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> on [Pnakotic Manuscripts](/card/04307) should pass the Revelation test without a commit.\r\n\r\n# Other tricks\r\n\r\n- You can take investigate action of [Flashlight](/card/01087) or unidentified [Ancient Stone](/card/04022) when using her <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability.\r\n- Not often useful but very cool : You can hold the [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) and [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) holds an another [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) if you want to go full fighting. To go for this, you need 1x [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) on you first without seeing the 2nd one. Use [Backpack](/card/04037) to thin down deck (don't pick [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) if found among 6 cards), then play [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021) and hope. Then you can nock 2 arrows on different bow and burst 6 damages.\r\n- [Jake Williams](/card/04008) : Has draw effect that works with the [Ancient Stone](/card/04230).\r\n\r\n# Solo?\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible with her evasion, early 2x [Ornate Bow](/card/04204) purchases, and some luck with [Dr. Elli Horowitz](/card/04021). I put on the Solo tag anyway because it is theoretically possible to pull off, but it will be hard having to reload the bow without someone else taking off the heat.\r\n\r\nI would modify the starting deck to include 2x [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) and never remove them. Something like [Swarm of Rats](/card/01159) is bad to evade as it has high <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> and Hunter to come back to annoy you later, when you could just punch it, but you have 1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>!",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n2x [Flamethrower](/card/04305) fits in 19 XP even with Taboo on! If you are not playing Taboo and is taking this deck to Standalone Scenario at 19 XP, I suggest using spare 2 XP for 2x [Leo De Luca (1)](/card/01554).\r\n\r\n[Venturer](/card/04018) works with [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) / [Flamethrower](/card/04305) / [Flashlight](/card/01087) in the finished deck. I want to rush to 1x [Flamethrower](/card/04305) ASAP so [Venturer](/card/04018) has something good to do, but I think 1x [Charisma](/card/01694) and 2x [Treasure Hunter](/card/04025) are more impactful. (Just commit [Venturer](/card/04018) while waiting for your first [Flamethrower](/card/04305).)\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nThis deck performs unexpectedly good for such a mindless \"throw all available decent Ally into the deck\" Lv. 0 deck. I slotted this Leo in right in the middle of on-going campaign on my test play and he is doing serious work for a 0 XP deck. Being balanced on tanking, fighting, investigating, and even actions from [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) to help moving, engaging, revealing location, etc.\r\n\r\n## <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> Ability and resources\r\n\r\nHis ability saves you an action and even reduce play cost. Playing [Guard Dog](/card/01021) at 2 cost and can even reload the dog while fighting without AoO felt really good.\r\n\r\nAs long as resources aren't dry **when your turn begins** then he's good to go. Therefore the actual key card of this deck is [Emergency Cache](/card/01088). You don't know whether you will get an Ally in your Upkeep draw or not, and if you do get one but you don't have enough resources even after discount, you missed your chance to play as <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> has to be triggered immediately on turn's start. The key to keep the Ally rolling is to keep your resources **3 or higher** by preemptively playing [Emergency Cache](/card/01088). The only problem will be drawing [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) in Upkeep, which requires 5 resources to immediately use the <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> play.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame I don't have XP space to upgrade [Beat Cop](/card/01018) to Lv. 2 one in the first 19 XP, but with Leo the Lv. 0 version is working quite well already. He gets +2 sanity to take and an important <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to land the attack, at 4 - 1 = 3 play cost.\r\n\r\n## Charisma and Shifting Slots\r\n\r\nThanks to the Revised Core Set, we all have [Charisma](/card/01694) in the collection now. (Though you can pretend you have one after paying 3 XP.) This is a very important card that works with [Mitch Brown](/card/04006), which gives 2 more slots for only **non-unique**. (<span class=\"icon-unique\"></span>) Without [Charisma](/card/01694), there is sometimes conflicting order with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) which is unique.\r\n\r\nSince there is only 1x [Mitch Brown](/card/04006) in the deck, a typical flow will be that you get either [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) (unique) or [Beat Cop](/card/01018) / [Guard Dog](/card/01021) (non-unique) first. Then you get one more among those three, before you found [Mitch Brown](/card/04006), making [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) + [non-unique]. 2 Ally is possible because you have [Charisma](/card/01694). \r\n\r\nThen after you put down [Mitch Brown](/card/04006), you have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) + [non-unique] + [Mitch Brown](/card/04006), with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) using [Charisma](/card/01694) quota (can host unique ally) and [Mitch Brown](/card/04006) using your normal Ally slot, and that [non-unique] **shifted to** using [Mitch Brown](/card/04006)'s extra slot seamlessly. Without [Charisma](/card/01694), the moment you play [Mitch Brown](/card/04006), [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) would fly away to discard pile. Right here you have 1 more non-unique slot to play too. (But don't let [Mitch Brown](/card/04006) dies, of course.)\r\n\r\n(Read about [Shifting Slots](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Shifting_Slots) here.)\r\n\r\n## Investigate!\r\n\r\nHave to say his 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is impressive, like [Roland Banks](/card/01001). With help of [Scene of the Crime](/card/04103), [Intrepid](/card/04192), 2x [Perception](/card/01090) never removed, 2x [Flashlight](/card/01087) never removed, and [Treasure Hunter](/card/04025), he is a Guardian that can have some clues.\r\n\r\nSometimes these clues are asked to be spent or dropped to bypass a treachery, so indirectly he is quite bulky not only for endless supply of Ally, but also by having some clues on him.\r\n\r\nInvestigation plays very well with his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability. You no longer have to use your actual actions to play Ally (you do need to setup the weapons and other things), and you don't want to since you would miss the discount. Action saved from not manually playing Ally is often used to Investigate, helping your actual clue finders.\r\n\r\n## Decorated Skull... is good\r\n\r\nInitially I add [Decorated Skull](/card/04026) just because he could, but I was pleasantly surprised what 1 draw and 1 resource **at the same time** meant for Leo. Screw mathematical action economy calculation. Payout of this card is different for Leo due to his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability.\r\n\r\nAs said before, you want some resources ready just in case you get an Ally in Upkeep Phase so you can put them down right away on his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. The <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> here gives you **both** potential Ally to play and the resource in addition to one you will get on Upkeep!\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have no Ally at all on hand / field and on the verge of death (often due to horror), and also having 0-1 resource, spending action on [Decorated Skull](/card/04026)'s <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> is not a bad way to survive. In addition to Upkeep resource you will get to 3 resources that allows you to found-and-play [Beat Cop](/card/01018) to add 2 more sanity, as well as the draw to gacha the Ally up to your hand. Analyze your discard pile if you want to bet on drawing Ally on critical moment.\r\n\r\n(And of course survive the incoming Mythos Phase, before you can get to the <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> trigger. [Take the Initiative](/card/04150) is good at this as it still have full <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.)\r\n\r\n# Tips\r\n\r\n- Leo has high chance to trigger [Intrepid](/card/04192) on any <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test he got in Standard difficulty, since he has starting 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> already. If you have [Leo De Luca](/card/01048), you get a longer turn with the boost. (Often you would have to Move, wasting some of the boosted action.)\r\n- He can help beating 4 shroud sometimes with either [Scene of the Crime](/card/04103), or activating [Intrepid](/card/04192) then commit [Perception](/card/01090) to get to 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n- [Treasure Hunter](/card/04025) is a good target to send to die in order to add charges to [Decorated Skull](/card/04026).\r\n- Upgraded [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01028) \"defeat\" on used up the health unlike the base version that straight up discarding, so they gains compatibility with [Decorated Skull](/card/04026). Upgrade comes after 19 XP.\r\n- Despite Leo's Ally discount, this deck is not good at economy.  (Weapons and [Scene of the Crime](/card/04103) are also expensive to play.) 2x [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) are all kept all the way, only replaced by an another economy related card 1x [\"I've had worse…\" (4)](/card/01684) at the end. (If you have [\"I've had worse…\" (2)](/card/05315) version from The Circle Undone, I think adding 2x of that one is better inside 29 XP. But this deck is limited to 2 packs.)\r\n- You can't kill-steal enemies on other players with [Flamethrower](/card/04305). You must engage with the enemy yourself. (And the other enemies you want to distribute damages, you must also currently engaging them.) But with [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) you would have a spare action to pick an enemy from your Seeker, etc. before turning up the heat.\r\n- Using [Leo Anderson](/card/04001)'s <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to play Ally will not reduce <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon on [Take the Initiative](/card/04150). You are not **taking** a Play action, you just play. This is unlike [Ursula Downs](/card/04002) in the same expansion, it says \"take\" and she is susceptible to AoO while doing so too.\r\n\r\n# Solo?\r\n\r\nThis deck has quite high density of investigation helpers, together with his 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>. He has his Ally for horror taking, high 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for horror treachery resistant, Ally health to just take <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery damage. I think this deck has real chance in solo play.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n☆ : Add the Customizable cards together with their upgrades below will cost you only equal to those upgrades.\r\n\r\nFilling all possible XP Roland could for [Custom Modifications](/card/09023) is tempting, (e.g. **☑☑☑☑ Quicksilver Bullet**) but this card still requires star to be aligning with the guns to play. From my test play, 10 XP stuck in a card like this is unwise. If you don't get it, and the guns, and the resources for both the guns and the mod, **and** commits to get the 3-over, you are very underpowered! I think [Custom Modifications](/card/09023) is best left at around 5 XP.\r\n\r\n# How to utilize clue dropping\r\n\r\n- [Analysis](/card/09049), [Bizarre Diagnosis](/card/09046) and [Captivating Discovery](/card/09047).\r\n- If you are about to fight and defeat an enemy on a location without any clue, then clue dropping is free, since you can pick back with his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. \r\n- [Research Notes](/card/09045) (removed for [Press Pass](/card/09055) later)\r\n- [Press Pass](/card/09055) : Get free use of [Bizarre Diagnosis](/card/09046) and [Captivating Discovery](/card/09047), or real extra action after committing [Analysis](/card/09049).\r\n- [Roland's .38 Special](/card/01006) : You are in more control to create a location that get +3. Sometimes a scenario boss fight location normally does not have any clue.\r\n- [Cover Up](/card/01007) : Drop a clue on low shroud location then try picking back to fix it easier.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\n- Since Roland's role is not a main clue finder, he is not afraid to drop clue and lose progress. Think of clues as his \"mana\" to play special cards. \r\n- Get economy to play guns, [Custom Modifications](/card/09023), [Press Pass](/card/09055), and [Field Agent](/card/09033) with [Empirical Hypothesis](/card/09041) : **☑☑ Research Grant**. Kill enemies and try to get **☑ Independent Variable** going together with his <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability.\r\n- You cannot rely on just [Empirical Hypothesis](/card/09041) to cover your expense, turns out you will get this setup only half of the campaign. [\"I've had worse…\" (4)](/card/01684) is added later to improve resource consistency as well as cancelling away those double horror attacks.\r\n- Use [Captivating Discovery](/card/09047) to get the pairing card that is otherwise depend on luck or not having many tutors. [Custom Modifications](/card/09023) is a card with many XP poured in, so worth finding it ASAP when you have the gun, or inversely find the gun when you found it already. [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) and [One in the Chamber](/card/09029) are also cards to be paired with the guns.\r\n- If playing The Scarlet Keys campaign, Roland's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and [Field Agent](/card/09033)'s <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> can instantly expose one concealed mini-card.\r\n- Don't forget to count the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon on [Analysis](/card/09049). This card can also be committed with no clues on you, you get just that <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.\r\n- **Don't forget to use the token redraw ability on [Custom Modifications](/card/09023).** This deck just came back from The Scarlet Keys campaign with so many shots to my friends head that I forgot I could redo the draw...",

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n☆ : Removing [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) will affect [St. Hubert's Key](/card/03269) heavy play cost and it can't be discounted with [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033). I am originally against these extra upgrades, but since [Time Warp](/card/03311) looks like a fun toy card towards the end of campaign where things go crazy, I think they worth the risk of worse economy.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) : You can kill 3 HP enemy in a pinch by performing a normal Fight (+ [Overpower](/card/01091)?) followed by 2 damage knife throw Fight. [Shrivelling](/card/01060) is often annoying to kill 3 HP enemy too, so having a melee finisher helps.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Spirit Athame**</span>](/card/03035) • : A better melee finisher to kill 3 HP enemy after one [Shrivelling](/card/01060) hit. Also it can boost [Shrivelling](/card/01060)'s accuracy by +2, but only if you are not planning to perform the finisher stab, exhaust is the cost of both options.\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Manual Dexterity**</span>](/card/01592) : Extend your fight turn vs. 2-3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy, or keep your 6 Health safe against 3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Uncage the Soul**</span>](/card/03033) : This card is sad until 2x [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) and 2x [Suggestion](/card/03268) joins the deck. Then you will almost always have things to put down at discount, especially with [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) down. Note that [Spirit-Speaker](/card/03014) is a Ritual.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Initiate**</span>](/card/01563) : Aside from many Spell Asset, this card **can** find [Seal of the Elder Sign](/card/03312)! Buying 2x [Seal of the Elder Sign](/card/03312) will have much more value with a great tutor like this.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Alchemical Transmutation**</span>](/card/03032)  : Emergency food for [Angered Spirits](/card/03015). For a card to be removed soon, I think [Scrying](/card/01061) is a better card with useful effect in 3+ players. But I guess many may want to try new Carcosa cards.\r\n\r\n# Seal of the Elder Sign : The Analysis\r\n\r\nFirst, the ability to get <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> usually mean you declare a win against this test. It is better than not drawing the token since it comes with positive value or effect.\r\n\r\nThe \"side-effect\" of <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> is often missed. For example looking at your own <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, it adds 1 charge to an asset. Sometimes you get <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> while stabbing with a [Knife](/card/01086) with no other Spell down, misses getting the charge. I call this kind of effect needed to be \"doubly lucky\" to get value of. \r\n\r\n[Seal of the Elder Sign](/card/03312)'s advantage is that you can plan to get the side-effect at the moment you want. Some investigators has very powerful side-effect **if it could be planned in advance**. Here are my suggested combination for Core + Carcosa card pool :\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [William Yorick](/card/03005) : Revive any card. Pop the <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> when there is a valuable card in the discard pile.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [Minh Thi Phan](/card/03002) : Return a skill card to the hand only if she commits it in the exact test that she got <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>. You can commit [Deduction](/card/01039) / [Eureka!](/card/03231), etc. on the test with [Seal of the Elder Sign](/card/03312) and surely get it back. (Do not choose [Seal of the Elder Sign](/card/03312) to return to hand since it is removed from game after test.)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [Sefina Rousseau](/card/03003) : +3 is high, and you can draw a utility Event like [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) up to hand to get ready for things.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [Daisy Walker](/card/01002) : Can get her a lot of draws. You can wait until she put down some books first.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003) : 2 resources may equal to an action for him.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [Wendy Adams](/card/01005) : Auto success with [Wendy's Amulet](/card/01014). She can use this to test some scenario quest which is often at high number but requiring a single success. Auto success also reduces the difficulty to 0, so it may open up combo with \"zero difficulty\" cards in The Scarlet Keys if you have it.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Difficulty Notice : ** Lola's deckbuilding requirement is obviously meant to be stronger the more player cards you have. She is 6th investigator in Carcosa, a \"gift\" kind of thing to also incentivized you to stick with the game longer. So her concept is completely against this economical 2 Packs Deck Guide series. Still, I want to provide more value for as many players starting out as possible with this deck series, that I tried making this Lola deck. So if you find she is underpowered playing this deck, seems like it is supposed to be that way. Good luck with the challenge! (And maybe you can discover other version of 2 packs Lola that I hadn't thought of?)\r\n\r\nYou may notice that this is similar to lower <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> [\"Skids\" O'Toole](/card/01003) with a splash of [Wendy Adams](/card/01005) ([Will to Survive](/card/01085) access, and 0 cost soaks [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114) + [Leather Coat](/card/01072))\r\n\r\n# Please use the Taboo\r\n\r\nNotice that [Lola Hayes](/card/03006) herself (front side) and [Crisis of Identity](/card/03019) got a positive Taboo. It is much better than what was printed on your physical copy. Limited card pool Lola would be a challenge even with these positive Taboo.\r\n\r\n# Early upgrade notes\r\n\r\nThe first 10 XP focuses on getting +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> weapon into the deck and making [Sleight of Hand](/card/03029) not a dead draw. Even so 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> is kind of unreliable. You still better find [Beat Cop](/card/01018) ASAP or hoard [Overpower](/card/01091) / [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) for that important strike vs. 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy.\r\n\r\n[Sleight of Hand](/card/03029) is natural with [Lupara](/card/03309) but into [.45 Automatic (2)](/card/03190) is a bit trickier. You probably need to be <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> from earlier turn, so you can use [Sleight of Hand](/card/03029) and then change to <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> to shoot the guns the next turn you want to fight. Taboo Lola can swap role 2 times with <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> but you don't want to waste actions in [Sleight of Hand](/card/03029) turn.\r\n\r\n[Stealth](/card/03028) : This card is getting removed but until then, use it to evade non-Hunter enemy. You need to move away once to left it there. If it is Hunter, then you need to move away **twice** because it didn't exhaust and it is going to come whack you, that's your whole turn! The only merit of this card is that it helps with Lola's middling <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> with no boost by making it easier. We upgrade her to fight better so she don't need to do this roundabout escapade anymore.\r\n\r\n[\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) : Her 3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is actually kind of nice to intentionally get activation on 2-4 shroud on Standard. I decided to remove all [Flashlight](/card/01087) (which requires setup) and left 2x of these for clue helping she could. (But remember that her primary role is a fighter, get a clue finder teammates.)\r\n\r\n# Mid upgrade notes\r\n\r\nYou will get the next Lv. 3 card : [Will to Survive](/card/01085), to add to Lv. 3 [Lupara](/card/03309). This card is similarly tricky that you need to be in <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> role the earlier turn, so next turn you can [Will to Survive](/card/01085) and swap to whatever you want to do. (Likely <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> to shoot the guns.)\r\n\r\nThough, if you want to stay with enemy this turn so the next turn you have full actions to [Will to Survive](/card/01085), you may use [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114) / [Leather Coat](/card/01072) to take hits. Play [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) will give you more 100% success actions. [Improvisation](/card/03018) can also help with the cost and bypass one role swap.\r\n\r\nThe final Lv. 3 card is 1x [True Survivor](/card/03273), to take advantage of 6x generic skill cards with Innate on it. Only [Overpower](/card/01091) is Practiced and incompatible.\r\n\r\n# Late upgrade notes\r\n\r\nThe final piece of constant buff is [Police Badge](/card/01027). With 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>, [Guts](/card/01089) will finally work to fully cancel those 2 horror treacheries she might get.\r\n\r\nThe badge's +2 action combo with [Will to Survive](/card/01085) and [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) to give you a big, stage drama protagonist turn. Please try going for this! (You need to be in <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> to use <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> on the badge, and likely [.45 Automatic (2)](/card/03190) with a lot of ammo ready.)\r\n\r\nAn another 3 card combo costing 4 resources to deal guaranteed 6 damage in a pinch is using [Improvisation](/card/03018) to <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> to play [Will to Survive](/card/01085) at 1 cost, then <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> swap to <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> to play [Lupara](/card/03309) at 3 cost (ignoring AoO, you must be already with enemy) then shoot 2 times at starting 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Without touching the chaos bag she probably can match almost all enemies in the game.\r\n\r\nThe remaining is upgrading the poor [Beat Cop](/card/01018) allies and patch things up with [Charisma](/card/01694) so you can have both [Leo De Luca](/card/01048) and [Beat Cop](/card/01018). (Or 2x [Beat Cop](/card/01018)) You probably need both on the field for end game for buff and soaks. Try using [Improvisation](/card/03018) to help with Ally play cost while gearing up. Good luck!\r\n\r\n# Ways to shoot yourself in the foot\r\n\r\nExamples :\r\n\r\n- You cannot play [.45 Automatic (2)](/card/03190) while engaged and skip AoO with [Narrow Escape](/card/03267), since to play the gun you must be in <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>, but to play [Narrow Escape](/card/03267) you need to be <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>.\r\n- [Narrow Escape](/card/03267) has very nice <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icons, but you need to be <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>.\r\n- If you were just fighting with [Lupara](/card/03309) then you can't [Dodge](/card/01023) unless you didn't <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> role swap or you spend extra <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> to do the Taboo role swap.",

[See more here!](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nRecently I was able to form a new play group with 2 newcomers, so I let them to choose whatever and I fill in the missing piece. For some reason Seeker is quite an unattractive role no one ever wanted to play, I always get to be the clue worker. I tried sneaking in evasion and arcane attacks in several previous decks, but it wasn't scratching the itch to hit things. This time is different, I will be hitting things while able to fill in Seeker role with this Minh.\r\n\r\nAverage <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> she can get is 4~5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) supporting the +1 damage. Ideal accuracy can get up to 7 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> with : [Gravedigger's Shovel](/card/03037) + [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) + [Scientific Theory](/card/08040) + [Dissection Tools](/card/09043) (2 evidences). If they are not quite lining up, she can still cheat a win with [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) + [Map the Area](/card/09048) + [Gumption](/card/09112) + [Exploit Weakness](/card/09105). Also with 2x [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) + 2x [Strength in Numbers](/card/08077), fixing [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) is not that frustrating.

The leyline pilgrimage maybe difficult unless you get this early, but there is no rush, since the Unidentified version has a handy <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icon which Minh can commit to  add <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.\r\n\r\nYou may try the new [Baseball Bat (2)](/card/09113) in The Scarlet Keys Investigator Expansion, but I found 2-handed weapon too much hassle to use with [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) able to come in and bump it out at anytime.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Tool Belt**</span>](/card/09120) : \r\n\r\n  - This can work around [The King in Yellow](/card/03011). When it comes you will have only 1 hand while you try to fix, this card allows switching assets from-to that 1 hand. When you finally fixed [The King in Yellow](/card/03011), you can restore into busy 2 hands without playing anything new.\r\n\r\n  - It allows [Dissection Tools](/card/09043) to witness enemy defeat easier, transitioning from other combinations like [Gravedigger's Shovel](/card/03037) + [Flashlight](/card/01087).\r\n\r\n  - [Fingerprint Kit (4)](/card/09057) exhausts so it may help to tuck it away after one use, and switch out [Dissection Tools](/card/09043) for buffs. (The other hand permanently holding [Gravedigger's Shovel](/card/03037) for self defense.)\r\n\r\n  - Keep the <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> cheat clue of [Gravedigger's Shovel](/card/03037) hidden for the right occassion while there is no enemy, while you work with [Flashlight](/card/01087) / [Fingerprint Kit](/card/09057).\r\n\r\n  - This card can be hard to find a moment to play for no immediate benefit. But with Minh, the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> commit is generally appreciated by your fighter after she adds <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to it.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Michael Leigh**</span>](/card/08086) ••••• : Allows [Gravedigger's Shovel](/card/03037)'s accurate +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to deal 2 damages a hit starting at 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Mitigates the [Dissection Tools](/card/09043) drawback of taking away 2-handed +1 damage options like [Baseball Bat](/card/01074), moving the damage to Ally slot instead. You can get more accuracy from [Scientific Theory (3)](/card/08040) or [Dissection Tools](/card/09043). You can also punch bare-handed for 2 damages with evidences. Minh can naturally fill up evidences since it is her primary role.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Map the Area**</span>](/card/09048) : You map at 8 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>! After, you can punch enemy here very accurately with [Michael Leigh](/card/08086)'s evidence. You can set [Archive of Conduits (Acheron)](/card/08042) leylines at the location you mapped for easy access. And you have high chance of discarding an enemy with [Exploit Weakness](/card/09105) here with either [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) or [Gumption](/card/09112).\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Dissection Tools**</span>](/card/09043) : Can be brought out from [Tool Belt](/card/09120) <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> just in time something is going to die, or when you need the buff. Very good card in high player count, as there are many who would kill enemies in front of your eyes for you.\r\n\r\n - Minh is regularly evading or passing <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery test at 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, thanks to +1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> here and +2 more icons average from her commit ability. ([Eureka!](/card/03231), [Exploit Weakness](/card/09105), [Map the Area](/card/09048), are all cards with 1 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> icon.)\r\n\r\n  - The +1 Sanity buff is useful to keep [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) working, since it checks \"remaining\" Sanity.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Archive of Conduits**</span>](/card/08042) •••• : The combo is to set leylines to 2 locations you had [Map the Area](/card/09048). Fight there, and you can land many [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) hits, or even [Exploit Weakness](/card/09105) with [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) / [Gumption](/card/09112). On arrival you can remove the leyline to try Investigate and get 1 evidence for [Michael Leigh](/card/08086). (Works even with no clue left.)\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Scientific Theory**</span>](/card/08040) ••• : 3 horror soak is important to keep [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) usable as well as giving the same stat pair as [Michael Leigh](/card/08086). [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) also has 3 Health to shield the Composure from breaking.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Fingerprint Kit**</span>](/card/09057) •••• : Exhaust is best used with [Tool Belt](/card/09120) so you can continue working with something else.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Exploit Weakness**</span>](/card/09105) : Use [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108), [Gumption](/card/09112), and [Map the Area](/card/09048) to get the discard on 3+ <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> or 3+ <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Gumption**</span>](/card/09112) • : This gets +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> from Minh as well!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Strength in Numbers**</span>](/card/08077) • : This gets +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> from Minh as well! Put down [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) for <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> class. More redundancy to [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) to help fixing [The King in Yellow](/card/03011).\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Gravedigger's Shovel**</span>](/card/03037)  : \"Ultimate\" weapon. [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) basically let you add damage to a high accuracy weapon. You can tuck it in [Tool Belt](/card/09120) when there is no enemy to prevent losing it to [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) (while the other hand is busy), if an enemy spawns you can swap out with <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> on the [Tool Belt](/card/09120).",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n❂ : [Prepared for the Worst (2)](/card/09036) and [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026) intended to stick on joins later, at this point stick just [Ever Vigilant (1)](/card/03023) and any 2 Tactic you like, which I like [Toe to Toe](/card/08020).\r\n\r\nGiving up [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026), [Ever Vigilant (4)](/card/09039), all versions of [On the Trail](/card/08084), then everything fits in 19 XP for Standalone Scenario, if you want to mess around with dogs for just one session. The 29 XP one is also OK for standalone but I think 2 additional weakness are too much for Mark's rapid drawing of cards.\r\n\r\nps. In a certain alternate universe, there are seven dogs...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://hallofarkham.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/bark0a.jpg\"/>\r\n\r\nThere are several new cards from TSK that turns the dog deck meme to dream, primarily [Motivational Speech](/card/09028), and [Hit and Run](/card/09066) which works with Mark's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> and [Toe to Toe](/card/08020).\r\n\r\nUnrelated to the dogs but since I limit expansions to be economical, I also use the new TSK [Prepared for the Worst (2)](/card/09036) and [Ever Vigilant (4)](/card/09039) to let him dabble into [Old Shotgun](/card/08088) play, which comes in the same EotE expansion as the [Sled Dog](/card/08127). Both are good with [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264) that comes with Mark's expansion.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Sled Dog**</span>](/card/08127) : \r\n  - Mark has the card draw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> ability to find more dogs better than typical investigators in the case of bad start. The damage soak to draw lands on previous dogs or the different breed [Guard Dog](/card/01021).\r\n\r\n  - 2/2 soak allowing up to 2 draws for Mark's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. The sanity soak does not allow drawing but is valuable for Mark's 5 sanity. This deck is noticeably sanity-safe if you are replacing dogs fast enough.\r\n\r\n  - With 1 dog, it's a sad 1 damage hit but at reassuring 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy once per turn. At least it is a good time to add [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) here to resist up to about -3, -4 token.\r\n\r\n  - With 2 dogs, they are unlimited 2 damage hit with 7 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy, but only one use per turn. Since [.32 Colt](/card/03020) has no accuracy boost, this is an excellent option to kill-steal 2 HP enemy engaging with others with less risk of friendly-fire, or hitting Retaliate enemy. [.32 Colt](/card/03020) take care of high HP but lower <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enemy engaged with you.\r\n\r\n  - 2 dogs can use the Move option to close in and attack with the [.32 Colt](/card/03020) / [Old Shotgun](/card/08088) too.\r\n\r\n  - This deck I think is above average at 0 XP. Since 2 dogs fits in 1 Ally slot making 4/4 soak, they are great in the 1st scenario where you may need more [Sophie](/card/03009) ubiquitous boost to do the job and farm XP. Try putting all the damages on dogs so Mark can fully use [Sophie](/card/03009) 4 times. (e.g. For clutch Evade at 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>, for treachery defense at 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>.) 6x level 0 cards to assemble the dogs : [Calling in Favors](/card/03158), [Hit and Run](/card/09066), and [Motivational Speech](/card/09028) makes his 1st scenario game much less swingy to treachery.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Old Shotgun**</span>](/card/08088) •• : There are dogs to serve as his sidearm, he has the hand slot free to summon the shotgun in correct way ([Ever Vigilant (1)](/card/03023), [Ever Vigilant (4)](/card/09039), [Prepared for the Worst (2)](/card/09036) makes it enter with 2 ammo), conserve ammo, or trying to refill with [Extra Ammunition](/card/01026), while fighting smaller enemies with [Sled Dog](/card/08127). Use [Sophie](/card/03009) or [The Home Front](/card/03007) to increase damage.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Hit and Run**</span>](/card/09066) : Put down a dog to take [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) hit (up to 1/1 damage/horror), Mark draws a card, then the dog go back to hand safely. [Guard Dog](/card/01021) can deal extra damage. [Guard Dog (2)](/card/09034) can get an engage for rescuing others and counters automatic 1 damage. [Sled Dog](/card/08127) can perform 1 exhaust attack before going back to hand.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**On the Trail**</span>](/card/08084) • / <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span><span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**On the Trail**</span>](/card/08085) ••• : Thematic inclusion just because there are dogs in the artwork... though, sometimes Mark can make distance with [Sled Dog](/card/08127)'s multi Move <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> and get some clues for real.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Motivational Speech**</span>](/card/09028) : Motivate all the dogs to 0 cost, plus you are able to play mid-engagement due to Parley. Parley make it possible to find emergency meat shield for [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) when caught off guard by an enemy with no Ally in play yet, like [Hit and Run](/card/09066).\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Inspiring Presence**</span>](/card/03228) : The one sided heal is good for [Sled Dog](/card/08127) which comes with both health and sanity room, for damage / horror distribution flexibility. The ready can inspire [Sled Dog](/card/08127) to go again too but unfortunately 1 dog is not going to do much. (Unless you got 3 dogs, then you can use 2 dogs 2 times.) The ready is sometimes useful for [Guard Dog (2)](/card/09034) to get 2 different engages in high player count.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Ever Vigilant**</span>](/card/03023) • / <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Ever Vigilant**</span>](/card/09039) •••• : 1x to [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264). Rapidly play the dogs, [Old Shotgun](/card/08088), and [Rod of Animalism](/card/08128).\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Prepared for the Worst**</span>](/card/09036) •• : Purchased 1x to [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264). Used to summon [Old Shotgun](/card/08088) with ammo, or at least you might get a [.32 Colt](/card/03020). Throw all the [Old Shotgun](/card/08088) away from your pre-mulligan hand to make ways for the dogs.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Extra Ammunition**</span>](/card/01526) • : Purchased 1x to [Stick to the Plan](/card/03264). Makes even 0 ammo [Old Shotgun](/card/08088) became playable.\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Toe to Toe**</span>](/card/08020) : Excellent card since Mark has a lot of dogs to take the hit, and then he gets a draw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span>. The card costing 0 resource to play is a treat!\r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Obsidian Bracelet**</span>](/card/09024) : Eventually all removed but it is very good to take damage treachery from others, like low <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Seeker friend, which Mark then gets a draw <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> since damage is placed on a card he control. [Ever Vigilant](/card/03023) makes it easier to put down.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Rod of Animalism**</span>](/card/08128) • : Further discount for [Ever Vigilant](/card/03023) plays of the dogs to just 1 cost. [Ever Vigilant](/card/03023) says one at a time so you can also play this before the dogs in the same Asset playing chain, so the dogs get more discount.\r\n\r\n- [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Calling in Favors**</span>](/card/03158) : Call for more dogs. All uniform 3 cost make sure you don't need to prepare any more resources to play the new Ally card. Since a dog is returned to hand, it is good to follow with [Ever Vigilant](/card/03023) or [Hit and Run](/card/09066). [Hit and Run](/card/09066) can also be played before this card, so a temporary dog turns into a real one.",

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nThis plan aims so you have at least 1x [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) ready when the other fighters / spell casters are trying to get high XP card in the deck. I predict the 3rd scenario at 9 XP. I call this \"staying on-sync\" with the team.  \r\n\r\nGetting 2x [Newspaper (2)](/card/03313) first makes it too late and the fighter may already have got a big gun in the deck that needs your assistant, so I get only one at first.\r\n\r\nBest if you have 2x [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) as they are struggling to add 1x big gun, saving for the other 1x. You can make that powerful card \"virtually\" 2x in the mean time. I predict the fighter gets full set of cards at 20 XP. So Minh must be selfless and ahead by completing full set of 2x [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) at 14 XP.\r\n\r\nIf someone wants to play <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>, they maybe delighted to try out some unplayed Exceptional card as game rule forced 1x inclusion and is very XP expensive. [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) is so good at this the <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> investigator will wants to marry you.\r\n\r\n# Next level role-play : What makes a good Assistant?\r\n\r\nOfficial \"Table Talk\" suggestion is that you cannot reveal what you have in your hand or going to play from hand. This includes the star of this deck [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) on your hand.\r\n\r\nOften, the table knows you have NSU as soon as you are asking what do they want. But you can take the role-playing experience to the next level by not asking and instead keep track of everyone's discard pile (an open information). Then try suddenly play this card and see if you can read the need in their mind or not! \r\n\r\nIf you took a look at everyone's deck beforehand, you know exactly what cards are left to search, **minus** the cards on their hand that you cannot see. They too cannot say \"I already have it in my hand, so no need to use [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307).\" So that's an another failure point that would get some lols.\r\n\r\nSince NSU also need to be the same location, there is also a risk of meeting up only to end up with no one wanting anything from their deck, when you cannot directly talk about the needs of a specific card when you were remote from each other.\r\n\r\nConsider this as a more challenging mode of play, but it is really fun.\r\n\r\n(One hardcore gaming group I play with even restrict any talk as if everyone has permanent Peril on them, unless they are at the same location!! We can only talk remotely/telepathically about Investigation Phase turn order!)\r\n\r\n# Let's talk about The King in Yellow\r\n\r\n(But do not say his name.)\r\n\r\n## Icons on non-Skill cards\r\n\r\nThis deck cares about skill icons **on non-Skill card** a lot to fix her [The King in Yellow](/card/03011), since I think this is the most annoying part for beginners. \r\n\r\nThis weakness force Minh to care about icons on Asset and Event cards because it is hard to find 3 chunky Skills in the first place (and it would be a shame to throw them all just to fix this weakness). You want any card draw ([Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) / [Analytical Mind](/card/03010)) to have a chance of fixing this ASAP, to make a solid Minh deck. Minh deck which does not care about icon concentration may perform much better, **only until** [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) hits then she is crippled. This deck is defensive.\r\n\r\nSo, cards like [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) (<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>) or [Fieldwork](/card/03024) (<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>) are sadly out. Because Minh would have hard time to commit 3x to clear <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> test. (And she do not want to go punch evils just to dispel [The King in Yellow](/card/03011), let she be in her office.) We want either <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons.\r\n\r\nInstead [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) which may look unnecessary for Seeker is in the deck to help with its double <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons, never removed.\r\n\r\n[Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) is also a good card to **not play** but use <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to pass treachery that swoop in once in a while, but you must find [Eureka!](/card/03231), or few remaining <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> commit to get to 3x commit count.\r\n\r\n## Wild\r\n\r\nYou know Minh adds <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>, but don't forget about commit rule. **You cannot commit icon not matching the test.** And because her ability is <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> \"After\", a card must be a legit commit first before you can add +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, a card with <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> in the first place is great for Minh even with the text box blank!\r\n\r\nThis deck has \"questionable card\" 2x [Guidance](/card/03265) and 2x [No Stone Unturned (0)](/card/03026). You will find unfavorable reviews if you look inside, but for Minh the <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> commit icon is a feature! These cards are just as good as more copies of [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093), for helping any kind of problems for others, or fixing [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) for yourself.\r\n\r\nOne very important application for a lot of single <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> cards we have in this deck is to make 4+ <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> for emergency evade vs. 2-3 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemies on Standard. It let you able to go separate way from your fighter for a little bit. [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075), [Guidance](/card/03265), [No Stone Unturned (0)](/card/03026)? ...they are all draw-less [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092).\r\n\r\n## Attention! : Icons on Item trait\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> on Item asset are important as it has synergy with [Scavenging](/card/01073) to get the icon back on hand ready to fix [The King in Yellow](/card/03011). Refilling [Flashlight](/card/01087) supplies after bumping it away with [Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01040) is one classic move, you will have many moments that <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> Item is on hand as they recurs, about to be replayed. If [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) hits in that time, then you have some head start and change your mind to commit them instead.\r\n\r\n[Magnifying Glass (1)](/card/01040) is an item with that built-in ability that \"counters\" [The King in Yellow](/card/03011). Just <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> pick up and commit! Then try [Scavenging](/card/01073) back later once you gain back an ability to commit 1 card.\r\n\r\nThen the upgrade [Newspaper (2)](/card/03313) is a very good card here not only because of its ability, but because Minh is a commit beast and [Newspaper (2)](/card/03313) can keep coming back via its Item trait. It has excellent <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons that became huge feature for Minh. Looks like her part time job is newspaper delivery...\r\n\r\nThen we have [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) that is as precious as a commit as playing it. With Minh's +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>, they are [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) that can come back via [Scavenging](/card/01073). Sometimes I feel a bit sad equipping it instead of committing it. (Best to equip one, and find an another to recur for committing.)\r\n\r\n[Scavenging](/card/01073) make sure not all hope is lost when you get that <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span> while going all in trying to fix [The King in Yellow](/card/03011).\r\n\r\n# Minh's ability tips \r\n\r\nBring some kind of on-off tokens representing each investigator in the team including yourself, to keep track whether someone still have the <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> quota or not.\r\n\r\nIt is really easy to miss, especially those who walk into your location thinking they cannot pass the test. **Their** cards also get <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>, it does not have to be your card. You just stand still!\r\n\r\nYou also prone to forget how many the round quotas were used in Mythos Phase, to decide whether you can go offensive in Investigation Phase or not.\r\n\r\nAlso it does not have to be Skill card. (But <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span> effect requires Skill card.)\r\n\r\nHer ability helps fixing [The King in Yellow](/card/03011), so you actually require 5 icons and not 6 as you get <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> for free.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Bulletproof Vest**</span>](/card/01594) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>, [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Elder Sign Amulet**</span>](/card/01595) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThey being in Extra section on the upgrade looks like mindless sprinkles, but don't forget about [Scavenging](/card/01073) **and** also potential of very high icon count with Minh's +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>. (<span class=\"icon-combat\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span><span class=\"icon-wild\"></span>) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Eidetic Memory**</span>](/card/03306) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nIt is not just for [No Stone Unturned](/card/03307), playing [Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) from discard pile is also excellent. As you can make use of the <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> commit first (adds <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to even allow a <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> to pass <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test) and then play from discard for effect if that test fails and cause horror. Double insurances! I already mentioned that <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> will love your [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) to get their Exceptional out. This is another reason to pair this Minh with a <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span>.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**No Stone Unturned**</span>](/card/03307) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••••</span>\r\n\r\nBeing team player is good but don't forget about grabbing [Analytical Mind](/card/03010) for yourself.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> : Add when you reach 15 XP. Should be the same time you get [Keen Eye](/card/02185), now you can occasionally use the <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> pump to work on clues full turn at 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.\r\n\r\n**True Solo :** Swap the [Keen Eye](/card/02185) to be the first 3 XP upgrade instead, so you are less likely to struggle with the investigation.\r\n\r\nTry go for 6 XP or higher in the 1st scenario! Triple attack will became much more usable.\r\n\r\nAt 30 XP where the campaign is likely ending, you can choose 1 more Discipline (not in the Side Deck). Choose any as you like, but I would pick <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> one so you can heal yourself back after using [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) inside a combo / horror cost of [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\nWith [Keen Eye](/card/02185) purchased very early on, Lily can get carryover stat bonus across all attacks for both [<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline](/card/08014a) and [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025). It helps mitigating some risk of having to pull many chaos tokens, avoiding \"if you fail\" effects.\r\n\r\n\"Different Fight\" actions to be used with [<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline](/card/08014a) are the [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025), basic fight, throwing [Knife](/card/01086) hidden in the [Bandolier](/card/02147), and finally Fight Event played from hand.\r\n\r\nThese Fight Event from hand must be **cheap**, or a combo would make you broke. We have : 2x [Toe to Toe](/card/08020), 2x [Sweeping Kick](/card/08023), and the peak \"**finish him**\" moment [Monster Slayer](/card/02300) added later as a fun toy. Everything costs either 1 or 0 resource to play.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd Discipline to add is [<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> Discipline](/card/08012a). Its ability (from now on referred to as \"hand refill\") can be used to grab some Fight Events in a hurry. Unusually low amount of equip assets improve the chance of dumping the hand and flip back this Discipline for more hand refills.\r\n\r\nThe final touch is that we need some damage plus card that can be used to add oomph to any attacks performed as a part of triple attack, so she is more flexible to make HP of multiple enemies become 0 exactly at the same time. (Making basic fight or the 1st hit of [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025) deal 2 damages is handy.)\r\n\r\nThis is the expensive [Michael Leigh](/card/08086), which links into [<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> Discipline](/card/08012a) you just added so you now have 4 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> to work on with [Flashlight](/card/01087). [Keen Eye](/card/02185) can add <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> if you need many evidences refilled in a pinch.\r\n\r\nMultiple enemies to fight with can be summoned from [On the Hunt](/card/03263), [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064), and [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111). [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025), [Michael Leigh](/card/08086), and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) improve the chance of clearing them out quick enough. Use bounty money from [On the Hunt](/card/03263) to help fuel [Keen Eye](/card/02185).\r\n\r\n# How to solo?\r\n\r\nI have put a \"solo\" tag due to investigation power gained in the later half. But it will be pain until you get [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) and <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> Discipline.\r\n\r\nBefore that point, it is critical to hog [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) for the 3-4 shrouds, and treat [Perception](/card/01090) / [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) like treasure, only popping them in your important [Flashlight](/card/01087) test.\r\n\r\nUpgrade plan moves [Keen Eye](/card/02185) to the first upgrade. +1 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> for 2 resources is your ray of hope with your 3 supplies [Flashlight](/card/01087). Keep [Flashlight](/card/01087) full before you do this since the boost stays active for an entire phase.\r\n\r\nLastly, solo is rarely balanced to any deck.\r\n\r\n# 5 splash cards\r\n\r\nThat means what are the 5 <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> cards we chosen for her to born with.\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Bandolier**</span>](/card/02147) \r\n\r\nCritical to equip [Knife](/card/01086) / [Flashlight](/card/01087) while playing with [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Toe to Toe**</span>](/card/08020) \r\n\r\nThe cheapest Fight Event we have to use with \"triple attack\". It is really handy since it has perfect accuracy, saving you both play cost and commit cards for the other attacks in the triple attack chain. But watch your health and sanity!\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n1x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Prepared for the Worst**</span>](/card/02184) \r\n\r\nThis is a virtual copy of [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025). The only other target is [Knife](/card/01086). You may include 2x of this but 1x [Bandolier](/card/02147) instead, both are related to gearing up this Lily. I take 1x to put more weight in [Flashlight](/card/01087) x [Bandolier](/card/02147) x [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) play.\r\n\r\n# How to fight in early scenarios\r\n\r\n[Knife](/card/01086), [Toe to Toe](/card/08020), and [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) are extremely valuable. They allows you to have more choices inside your [<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline](/card/08014a) triple attack.\r\n\r\nWhen you get 3 or 4 HP enemy, often you can use triple attack in combination with [Knife](/card/01086)'s 2 different Fight to get its HP down to 2 however you like.\r\n\r\nOnce that happens, then it is GG with [Toe to Toe](/card/08020)'s test-less 2 damage as your final different Fight inside the triple attack.\r\n\r\n[Knife](/card/01086) has 2 <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> choices which are considered \"different Fight\". So for 3 HP enemy, it is fine to try your first 2 attacks and hit it with +1 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> once, then use the +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> +1 damage option to finish it off and discard the [Knife](/card/01086).  Two <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> in one Asset is good since you don't want to include your unboosted barefisted Fight just so it is \"different\". Not anymore that [William Yorick](/card/03005) is the only one stylin with the [Knife](/card/01086)!\r\n\r\nIf inside triple attack you made 2 attacks and can't quite get the HP down to 2, you may change your mind to Evade with [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) instead. (Discipline flips over after the final action, you still have <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> +1 bonus while evading inside the triple attack.) \r\n\r\n[Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) is never removed for this reason because it gives flexibility to the triple attack, letting you see the result of 1-2 fights first.\r\n\r\nBecause [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) are removed but not immediately that [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) are added, you have some period that you have no soak. Be very careful about using [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) around this point. (5 XP ~ 15 XP)\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Monster Slayer**</span>](/card/02300) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••••</span>\r\n\r\nThe ability make it obvious that damage does not matter, but the accuracy does since it doesn't give you any <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> bonus. Therefore, when playing as a part of \"triple attack\" you must buff it with some <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.\r\n\r\nIt is purchased after [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) so you at least have 5 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>. Still, you should put in [Overpower](/card/01091) or other <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> commits.\r\n\r\n[Keen Eye](/card/02185) can add <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> to it as well, a bit expensive but good value if you are doing triple attacks with [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025) in it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**On the Hunt**</span>](/card/08028) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nThough this Lily could somewhat investigate in her free time, this card can make sure you don't have to run around and grab enemies from Seekers. You can make the encounter deck \"sparkling clean\" on your own instead of struggling with gathering clue. Also important so her \"triple attack\" is utilized to the fullest instead of hitting airs.\r\n\r\nYou may search for Victory Point enemy and get closer to 30 XP faster where you get the 3rd discipline. (Your choice)\r\n\r\nThis also has subtle synergy with [Ward of Protection](/card/01065) which is never removed. That card cannot cancel enemy spawn, so the more you use [On the Hunt](/card/03263), the more chance of getting \"Revelation\" mythos draw that could be canceled with [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) \r\n\r\nThis is a staple, but just to note that it is also a quick fix when you get Revelation card instead of enemy when you [Delve Too Deep](/card/02111) or [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01588) \r\n\r\n2 copies are not getting removed ever, even when 2x [On the Hunt](/card/08028) are all added. When you add [Michael Leigh](/card/08086), this Lily will be really hungry for a quick shot of resources so she can get going with him, plus to use [Keen Eye](/card/02185). Find some time to use it, maybe when trying to flip back <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline in isolation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Flashlight**</span>](/card/01587) \r\n\r\nThis is critical to make [Michael Leigh](/card/08086) work as she need to somehow investigate. It is also the reason that [Bandolier](/card/02147) is included in the splash. Together with <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> Discipline's static boost it is enough to get some evidences.\r\n\r\nFrom [Bandolier](/card/02147)'s description (Weapon trait only) it may looks like you put one half of the [Butterfly Swords](/card/08025) in it while you hold an another half, and [Flashlight](/card/01087) in the other hand. This is totally fine. Slots are upper limit rather than a physical slot, and 2-handed weapon is just using 2 out of that limit.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Manual Dexterity**</span>](/card/01592) \r\n\r\nThis is not removed. Not only that her 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> + 2 will be reassuring to avoid treachery, just to remind you that <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> Discipline allows using basic evade as a part of combo, not just Fight.\r\n\r\nThe real power is in changing your mind when you see the enemy is not going down after you missed 1 or 2 attacks.\r\n\r\nMany enemies have annoying ability disabled when they are not ready, so sometimes sneaking in evasion is useful to reach the next round safely, while getting in some hits.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Perception**</span>](/card/01590) \r\n\r\nAlso not removed, it improve the chance of refilling [Michael Leigh](/card/08086)'s evidence even when you can't get the [Flashlight](/card/01087) + [Bandolier](/card/02147) combo going. Or just when you have no choice but to investigate difficult locations just to get the evidences ready.",

# (===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\nYou may notice a card [Suggestion (4)](/card/03268) in your The Path to Carcosa Investigator Expansion purchase which looks like it is made just for Sefina. This deck devoted the XP for 2x [Hot Streak](/card/01057) instead in the pre 20 XP range. Then at 20 XP, I think it is time for [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) to get in the deck to handle late campaign negative values when killing stuff with a basic [Shrivelling](/card/01060) or performing critical Evade. Therefore we have no moment to add [Suggestion (4)](/card/03268), unfortunately!\r\n\r\n- She can neutral Evade to prolong fight turns or get a brief moment to gear up.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Moxie**</span>](/card/03111) • : pumps both <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for Spell accuracy and <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> to avoid getting hit. [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) (1/2) and [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) (<span class=\"icon-null\"></span>/2) are both great core set cards that provide high Sanity buffer at cheap play cost, helps soaks the horror instead of having to break the Composure. It just clicks with <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> combination.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Narrow Escape**</span>](/card/03267)  : Amazing Event with many many uses in this deck. Removes a lot of <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> clunkiness.\r\n  - You can just simply setup something like [Shrivelling](/card/01060) with engaged enemy, and use the +2 to cast accurately right away.\r\n  - You want to use [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) on your last action each round, to work around the turn ending penalty. With an enemy, Investigate takes Attack of Opportunity and may ruin that chance now and then. This card allows you to still take the chance and even get +2 for that Investigate, you have at least 8 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to resist even -4 vs. 4 shroud.\r\n  - [Uncage the Soul](/card/03033) is useful to setup Spell Asset, but for Fight Spell Event like [Storm of Spirits](/card/03153) you have to take Attack of Opportunity when trying to discount it. But with [Narrow Escape](/card/03267), you avoid the hit, get the discount, and even get +2 towards [Storm of Spirits](/card/03153) accuracy which previously has no boost.\r\n  - Use non-fast Event like [Sneak Attack (2)](/card/03152) or [Drawn to the Flame](/card/01064) while you have an enemy, and bank the +2 for anything that comes next.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Hot Streak**</span>](/card/01557) •••• : Pure economy for [Moxie](/card/03111) pumps and refreshing Spell Asset with a new one. If you managed to get it under Sefina and use [The Painted World](/card/03012), you are well off for long time.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Sneak Attack**</span>](/card/03152) •• : Test-less damage that is very good in high player count, since there are more chances that an enemy spawns on someone else but not you.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**Sure Gamble**</span>](/card/01556) ••• : A quite costly card (XP and play cost too) but can be a game changer in last few scenarios where the tokens are really amped up in negative value. I think to give Sefina a unique identity, it is important we try playing around with <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> Lv. 3+ cards.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-rogue\">**\"Watch this!\"**</span>](/card/03233) : The <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> icon is great for spells, as well as being quite safe to bet 3 resources when using [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689) (+2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>) with [Spirit Athame](/card/03035) (+2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>). Typical Rogue has like 1~2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> would not say \"Watch this!\" as easily as Sefina on <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test.\r\n\r\nFor the <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> side : \r\n\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Spirit Athame**</span>](/card/03035) • : Adds +2 accuracy to [Shrivelling](/card/01060) which previously does not have any accuracy bonus. Takes the pressure off finding one of 2x [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) a bit for a Mystic with 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. (But you should still find it.)\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Rite of Seeking**</span>](/card/01689) •• : Insanely good card in Revised Core Set due to built-in +2 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> accuracy. On Standard, you will be quite consistent in tackling 4 shroud with this card. Add [\"Watch this!\"](/card/03233) on this test if you are lacking resources.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/03270) •• : Share the love more times with [The Painted World](/card/03012). Remember that [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can search for them.\r\n- <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Recharge**</span>](/card/03197) •• : Positioned at the bottom of upgrades so likely that you won't reach them, but it is <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> that [Arcane Initiate](/card/01063) can search since it is a Spell, and allow more of the satisfying [Rite of Seeking (2)](/card/01689).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Note on [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013)\r\n\r\nThe \"If your deck has 5 or more cards...\" clause is brutal. You will run out of \"ideas\" (the cards underneath her) before it gets to that point.\r\n\r\nImagine that your deck had thinned down to 10 cards. You have also hit 1-2 [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013) before this point, and you are down to 0-3 Event. Right now if [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013) is on the top 5 cards instead of the bottom 5, you lose! Then it shuffles back into the deck of about, let's say 7 cards. Then, if [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013) is on top 3 of that 7 cards, you lose again! It gets harder and harder towards that 5 cards threshold, which at that point.. you have to hit [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013) **again** one last time in this iteration of the deck it finally goes to the discard pile.\r\n\r\nYou rarely play long enough to get to that point of deck-out unless you draws often (like having [Pickpocketing](/card/01046), which I avoid) so you may as well read that once the deck thins down to single digit count Sefina just randomly dies. Not only you lose your precious Health, you lose so many draws.\r\n\r\nIn this deck, we have 2 mitigators :\r\n\r\n- 2x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Arcane Initiate**</span>](/card/01563) : This is a drawing that avoids [Stars of Hyades](/card/03013), so always welcomed as the deck thins down more and more.\r\n- 1x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Quantum Flux**</span>](/card/03196) : Do not count on the 5 cards criteria, just simulate the deck-out on your own. Because this is situational, I add only 1 copy. You should hold onto it until you get to about last 30% of the deck before using it, I think.",

Many cards are required to stick to the other investigator : [Encyclopedia](/card/01042), [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031), [Foresight](/card/08064), [Occult Theory](/card/08065), [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041).\r\n\r\nEven [Blur](/card/08109)'s placeholder to use in the first scenario is [Blinding Light](/card/01066) instead of [Shrivelling](/card/01060). Evade once, commit to make it count, instead of trying to kill the enemy. It is cheaper and does not require setting up beforehand too. (You should setup your books and [Holy Rosary](/card/01059).)\r\n\r\n# Choosing the lead investigator\r\n\r\n[Alyssa Graham](/card/02232)'s looking at 1 top card of encounter deck meant the lead will draw that card before going clockwise every time. The rule states you can change the lead every start of scenario.\r\n\r\n- If you know the scenario that health damage will occur to the lead, then you don't be the lead since you have 5 health.\r\n- Otherwise, you should be the lead so you know when to equip [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041). Alternatively if other is the lead, they need to move to your location to trigger the disc.\r\n- After you obtained [Occult Theory](/card/08065), let low <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> character or character at risk of being defeated by horror be the lead, so you know when to group up and give your +5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost, potentially cancelling dangerous treachery.\r\n\r\n# Playing around treachery with no combos\r\n\r\nKnowing the mythos deck with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) or [Parallel Fates](/card/60415) without any other cards (e.g. [Foresight](/card/08064), [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041)) are far from useless. It may not appears so until you play.\r\n\r\nFor example, investigate in order to force a tie of \"with most clues\" so you can choose where it lands, or manipulate \"your location\" for card such as [Obscuring Fog](/card/01168). Drain out your resources before you lose it. Put down fodder asset so you don't lose an important one. Just group up for commits. etc.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I often activate [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232)'s <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> on mythos deck as soon as the first action of the first investigator, since it can influence how we spend actions.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span><span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-dual\">**Blur**</span>](/card/08109) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly priority card in setting up this Daisy. Her free tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> won't be usable if you are engaged with an enemy. With [Blur](/card/08109), you get back an action after evasion, then you can read [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) right away, potentially to the fighter that will pick up the fight from you after it stop exhausting. Even if you got 2 enemies, since [Blur](/card/08109) doesn't exhaust and give you back an action each time, it is possible to chain [Blur](/card/08109) back to back and still get away or even tap [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) and fight back.\r\n\r\nAoO-free state is so important to Daisy + [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) that it should be setup even before [Encyclopedia](/card/01042), or soon after. Since we have 1 copy of [Encyclopedia](/card/01042), [Blur](/card/08109) can also be a target to lose asset instead of [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) at reasonable 2 play cost.\r\n\r\nHas some synergy with [Written in the Stars](/card/08034), as it extends your turn by giving an extra action. Getting away from enemy will not waste you any time to look at the stars. This way if you decided to [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) in an attempt to get +<span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> for [Blur](/card/08109) but instead get <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, if you do get away you have more actions to utilize the <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> boost.\r\n\r\nHaving [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) is important to succeed or avoid getting the 1 damage rebound, boosting to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> combined with +1 bonus from [Blur](/card/08109). This number is unreliable against 4 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy, but fortunately, [Blur](/card/08109) won't cost a charge if failed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Parallel Fates**</span>](/card/08066) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThe superstar of this deck. 6 cards rearranging is a wonder, and it even let you draw the first one you just arranged. The cost is 0!\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to keep those cards open on the deck for beginners so you don't have to remember. It can take many turns to completely use up all those information. This is not cheating as long as the deck aren't shuffled yet as it is equivalent to getting a piece of paper to note what were the cards, which is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the 1st card, the other 5 cards is a huge window to arrange for an ideal sequential plays. Here are some tips of using this awesome card : \r\n\r\n- You see your weakness among 5 and also [Foresight](/card/08064). Just arrange [Foresight](/card/08064) in front of that weakness and then you can zap the weakness away. If the deck comes halfway and you are still not seeing your weakness and at least 1 remaining [Foresight](/card/08064), this card can take off unexpected risk.\r\n- You can arrange [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) play without even having [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) on hand yet. If you come halfway through the deck with out seeing any [Written in the Stars](/card/08034), use it on your deck! If you find it among 6 cards. Surely some skill cards will be among that. Simply arrange it in front of the skill cards. Count the discard pile how many [Deduction](/card/01039) or [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227) was used to decide where you want to be when popping [Parallel Fates](/card/08066).\r\n- Put [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) behind [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) so you don't miss a beat and use prior turns gathering resources for her.\r\n- When you are setup with [Occult Theory](/card/08065) + [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) + [Ward of Protection](/card/01065), it is possible to arrange a \"nice mythos deck\" such that the disc cancels an enemy, the victim of <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test gets an [Occult Theory](/card/08065) commit and effortlessly pass, and lastly Revelation treachery lands on you to ward away. Feels like a boss without actually fighting or investigating!\r\n- Use [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) after when some of the cards are not interesting to shuffle them away. Take in account the 3 cards window of [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) as well. [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) + [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) on the fighter usually makes a better game state whether weapon was found or not.\r\n- Arrange any \"sticky\" treacheries with a test to fix such that it allows you to use [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) buff and fix easier.\r\n- Making sure you have [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008) before [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) stealing your hand.\r\n\r\nIt's icon is looking similar to [Guts](/card/01089), so [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) can also work well with this card to pull off a [Blur](/card/08109) and also get a <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to work on other stuff.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Holy Rosary**</span>](/card/01559) \r\n\r\nClassic and critical card for Daisy since she has no other <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> boost in this deck.\r\n\r\nOther than treachery defense, it is just for [Blur](/card/08109). It gives +1 skill bonus to 4 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span>. You will need 1 more from this to 5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to make it winnable against 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>/<span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> enemy in an emergency (with a commit or two).\r\n\r\nSuccessful [Blur](/card/08109) is critical as it gives you an action to move away to continue working immediately, not ended up in a situation that you have to keep avoiding and got engaged again until the fighter arrive, and restore back your chance to use free tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> without getting AoO hits.\r\n\r\nLastly, it can helps with getting horror healing from [Fearless](/card/01067) and the over-success bonus on its upgrade. You have to heal horror from fixing [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) and using [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/01588), [<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Emergency Cache**</span>](/card/02194) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nIt is easy to underestimate this card and especially its upgrade! But maybe you also underestimated a life without [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033).\r\n\r\nI have tried without [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and it results in some painful turns of having [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) or [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) but cannot play it. We need some resource injection to get your resource \"ahead\".\r\n\r\nFor setting up her books, you must always consider +2 from [Research Librarian](/card/01032) to get on express way to get that book too. So it often ended up that [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) or [Old Book of Lore](/card/01688)'s setup cost is 4~5. You don't want to use your last remaining 2 resources to play [Research Librarian](/card/01032) (at that point your game state is not much better since the book is on your hand and the dude has poor soak), then wait 2~3 painful turns to put down the book, at that point an enemy is sticking on you.\r\n\r\nWhenever you got the first copy of this and have a moment to play, most of the time you should play it even though seemingly you don't need any more resources now. Don't wait until you find the card to spend resource. (For the 2nd copy, you may delay playing unless you recently lose resources due to scenario.) Unless you managed to use [Foresight](/card/08064) -2 discount and [Old Book of Lore](/card/01686) -2 discount to help with economy, then maybe not playing any is OK.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) \r\n\r\nWhen you use [Parallel Fates](/card/08066), it maybe possible to arrange such that you don't draw the enemy but something with Revelations.\r\n\r\nYou must always mythos draw \"in player order\", not freely unlike how you take turns in investigation phase. Therefore you must use the arrange feature of [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) while looking at your player order.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Painkillers**</span>](/card/02117) \r\n\r\nThis basically rebalances her 5 - 9 to something else on demand. Sometimes you are caught off-guard by the fail-by <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> tests bringing your tiny 5 health to critical. This can be godsend to fix that kind of situation.\r\n\r\nYou can put the horror cost on [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232)'s high 3 horror soak, preparing her to die along with her doom. Yes it make no sense but it didn't say \"direct horror\"...\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Inquiring Mind**</span>](/card/02227) \r\n\r\nThis is your best defense against <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> treachery tests that could kill you fast, other than fixing the situation with [Painkillers](/card/02117).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, her 2 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> needs +3 to have a chance of avoiding danger, so [Manual Dexterity](/card/01092) and [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) didn't make the cut.\r\n\r\nThis is a great [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) target, should you see it with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Alyssa Graham**</span>](/card/02232) \r\n\r\nCore card to look often at various decks. +<span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> is useful too.\r\n\r\nUsually I look at mythos deck, it really shift the mindset of an entire team when thinking what to do with actions. But if I have [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) then I sometimes look at my own deck in order to pull off a power play, depending on concentration of good skill cards left in the deck.\r\n\r\nThe problem is 4 play cost, and maybe you are not used to a Seeker life without [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033). That's why [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) and its upgrade is critical for this deck.\r\n\r\nTry putting 1 or 2 horrors on her early so she can die along with her doom when you wants to. This sounds horrible, but when you see Elite enemy coming up next and you have no equipments, you will want to put doom on her to bury that enemy regardless of agenda state!\r\n\r\nAfter using the doom bury ability, it is recommended for beginners to left that card face up at the end of deck. Sometimes with thin mythos deck, you will really deck out and see that card again and it can be useful to remember what was buried. This is not cheating as long as the deck aren't shuffled yet as it is equivalent to getting a piece of paper to note what was the card.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Written in the Stars**</span>](/card/08034) \r\n\r\nHappy time when you see the 2 pips skill cards or [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227). Of course try to look at your deck with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) or [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) then remember the arranged cards.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Disc of Itzamna**</span>](/card/01541) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nHas slot contest with [Holy Rosary](/card/01059). But you can delay equipping this until you really see an enemy coming with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) or [Parallel Fates](/card/08066).\r\n\r\nOnly 1 copy, I think it is just right without having to buy [Relic Hunter](/card/01695).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Encyclopedia**</span>](/card/01542) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nPairs well with [Blur](/card/08109) equipped, it make sure you have turn order flexibility and can buff yourself or the fighter even if you draw an enemy.\r\n\r\nWith [Research Librarian](/card/01032) and no book, I think [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) is a better pick if the fighter still can't get the equipments. You can use [Old Book of Lore](/card/01031) to find the other [Research Librarian](/card/01032) or the [Encyclopedia](/card/01042).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Old Book of Lore**</span>](/card/01686) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nGetting 1 extra draw each turn with free Tome <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> is already good, but this draw is filtered to be \"good\" because you pick one from 3. The other 2 cards that got shuffled back in turn make your late game deck filled with good stuff too, as you filtered out \"setup\" cards from repeatedly using the book.\r\n\r\nAlways talk with the fighter what else the character needs and keep reading the book for them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Deduction**</span>](/card/02150) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nIf you can [Parallel Fates](/card/08066) or [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) your deck and arrange this for [Written in the Stars](/card/08034), you essentially can turbo through the act.\r\n\r\n[Parallel Fates](/card/08066) is nice as you can make it earlier or later as you want, so you can be in the right location that needs draining clue. (Remember that you must draw each turn, so it is possible to \"miss the train\" if not careful / unexpected treachery interrupted you.)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Fearless**</span>](/card/02268) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nTry using this with your [Blur](/card/08109) test to grab the horror healing. It is important as you will take 3 horror from [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) to restore your hand slot, if you don't have luck getting [Daisy's Tote Bag](/card/01008).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Foresight**</span>](/card/08064) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nLook at things to foresight with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232) or [Parallel Fates](/card/08066).\r\n\r\nIt is also critical to use the -2 play cost feature, not just cancelling, since this deck has no [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033). (Upgraded [Old Book of Lore](/card/01686) can also help with saving cost.)\r\n\r\nGood <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> icons increase the chance of using [Written in the Stars](/card/08034) blind and hitting something useful. This is an upgrade from [Seeking Answers](/card/02023) which has mixed icons.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Occult Theory**</span>](/card/08065) <span class=\"card-xp\">•</span>\r\n\r\nAt first I include this card just because it is quite underused, and it matches thematically with this Daisy since she seems interested in more \"occult\" <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> stuff than usual.\r\n\r\nIt gives either +5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> (!!) or +3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> and cannot be used with tricks such as [Written in the Stars](/card/08034).\r\n\r\nThe play you should be looking for is **not for yourself**, but by throwing this card for +5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> to help the lead investigator escape danger.\r\n\r\nFor maximum benefit, choose the weak willed investigator such as <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> to be the lead then keep looking at encounter deck with [Alyssa Graham](/card/02232). Once <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test come up, go to the same location as the lead to pitch in your [Occult Theory](/card/08065).\r\n\r\nWith this much bonus, it \"cancels\" the treachery just like [Ward of Protection](/card/01065).\r\n\r\nMany <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> quests exists, like fixing sticky treachery or defeating an enemy without force using special action in its text box. The +5 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> will help you getting through especially if 1 big success is all it needs.\r\n\r\nThe +3 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> side can work like [Inquiring Mind](/card/02227) without clue on location requirement. You can allow non-clue investigator to take a shot at 3-4 shroud location to pick up a leftover clue and have more turn flexibility sometimes.\r\n\r\nThere is a little trick with [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) I managed to pull off in my Edge of the Earth Hard run. Use [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) to +2 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> on yourself and work on clues for all 3 actions. The next investigator can come to your location and get [Occult Theory](/card/08065) commit (perhaps to fix sticky <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> treachery) for +7 <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> (not +5), since [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) says the end of \"phase\", not turn. You still have 7 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>.",

[See more here!](https://arkhamdb.com/decklists/find?author=5argon)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\n- [In the Thick of It](/card/08125) giving enough XP to purchase [Charon's Obol](/card/03308) on the first scenario. The remaining XP goes to [Cat Burglar](/card/01055). Choose 2 mental trauma so he is just 1 short to use the Desperate skill cards.\r\n- Prepare an another **successor deck** you want to play for real because he will be killed by [Charon's Obol](/card/03308)'s effect in the 1st scenario. [Game rule](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Trauma) says you can replace him with a new 0 XP character in the next scenario, therefore getting killed in the 1st scenario nets you the least XP disadvantage for your next investigator. You can even make up a nice story for this new character!\r\n- Focus on evasion and investigation, especially using [Cat Burglar](/card/01055) that we use the remaining 1 XP for. Try to delay defeating the enemies until you get [\"I'll see you in hell!\"](/card/03189) or [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) and make sure you die with them. You don't want to survive to the next scenario or your successor character would miss out more XP.\r\n- Other hurt cards exists to make sure you do not survive to the 2nd scenario : [\"Get behind me!\"](/card/08021), [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022), [Toe to Toe](/card/08020), [On the Hunt](/card/03263). You will look so heroic while making easier time for everyone!\r\n- [.32 Colt](/card/03020) + [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) / [Flashlight](/card/01087) + [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) / [21 or Bust](/card/08048) + [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) / [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) + [Physical Training](/card/01017) pairs are similar cards that adds back consistency in [Underworld Support](/card/08046) condition.\r\n- On replays, you may know which 1st scenario that [Pocket Telescope](/card/08097) has an advantage. You may plan to have someone reveal the location ahead of Skids, and have Skids investigate remotely for action compression.\r\n- He will need [Hard Knocks](/card/01049) or [Physical Training](/card/01017) to make the [.32 Colt](/card/03020) or [.45 Automatic](/card/01016) 2 damages hit.\r\n- Try dying as late as possible because per-investigator clue count and difficulty stays the same after you are gone. (But there is 1 less player drawing Mythos.)\r\n- [Underworld Support](/card/08046) reduced deck size improves the chance of finding [On the Lam](/card/01010), which should be used to collect enemies before killing yourself with [\"I'll see you in hell!\"](/card/03189), for the best cutscene. Also with less cards it makes tearing down this deck back to your collection faster.\r\n- Try [Toe to Toe](/card/08020) to get 1 more horror so you can use Desperate cards. These cards restore the redundancy of skill cards in [Underworld Support](/card/08046) constraints.\r\n- If you \"accidentally\" survives the 1st scenario and got the unintended [Charon's Obol](/card/03308) XP boost, you can instead spend that XP to play a standalone scenario and kill yourself there. This might also net your friends some special Asset cards.\r\n- It might also be handy if someone wish to join your ongoing campaign for only 1 session and drop off afterward. The Desperate skill cards and [\"I'll see you in hell!\"](/card/03189) can do some work even if joined mid campaign at 0 XP.\r\n- You can take [Advanced On the Lam](/card/90009) (Try make some plays with [Dynamite Blast](/card/01024) after using the disengage effect.) from the Parallel print-and-play for free and completely ignore [Advanced Hospital Debts](/card/90010)! **Skip hospital straight to coffin.**",

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n❂ : The other [Calling in Favors](/card/03158) and [Lantern](/card/03036) cards are left in the deck.\r\n\r\nThis plan looks empty but genuinely I like a lot of the starting level 0 cards, including [Lantern](/card/03036) and all 8 skill cards.\r\n\r\nThis is perfect moment to try out expensive utility cards like [No Stone Unturned (5)](/card/03307) and [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) which fills your campaign XP quota.\r\n\r\n[A Test of Will](/card/03156) is an exile filler so you can spend more XP repurchasing it if you get even more.\r\n\r\n# Tips for Minh's ability\r\n\r\n- Cards with special effect on success but having low icon (preferably also having wide test coverage) like [Eureka!](/card/03231), [Resourceful](/card/03039), or [Opportunist](/card/01053) are good! They are designed so you need to add some more to trigger the effect, but now with Minh's +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> it could work on its own. Dunwich 2 XP skill cards that has oversuccess effect can be very powerful, but I assume we don't have that set here.\r\n- Find some tokens representing each player on the board and use it to remember whether you have gave <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> to that investigator this round or not. Usually by the time Mythos Phase is over you forgot you have used the ability for which test of who, if you bunched up together to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\n# Dealing with [The King in Yellow](/card/03011)\r\n\r\nIf you have not played her before, this is a very harsh weakness that make you commit 3+ cards or no commit at all. Moreover to fix it, you need 6 icons. So if 3 cards of <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span><span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span>, and <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> then it let you commit, but you cannot fix [The King in Yellow](/card/03011), lol!\r\n\r\nCards with double icons like [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) and [Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) are there to help you bomb the book in the early game, but very likely you need to hoard at least 1 [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) to be sure. In the case of [Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) and <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test, other than [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) you need [Eureka!](/card/03231) or [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) for the last <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> card.\r\n\r\n[The King in Yellow](/card/03011) is the best moment to beat difficult location with [Deduction](/card/01039) in the mix. Other than ensuring [Deduction](/card/01039) works you get rid of the book at the same time.\r\n\r\nAnd for some reason this very test you are committing 3 cards+ of 6 icons, that the bag loves to give you <span class=\"icon-auto_fail\"></span>. If that occurs and deck reset is far away, you may try to \"live with it\" by collecting 3 of single icon cards to commit wastefully until the end of scenario. Later on 2x [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) will help you muster up an another go to fix the book.\r\n\r\nAlso Minh's ability adds one <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> which is always a matching icon, so you actually need to go to 5 icons instead of 6 if you have not used the ability this round.\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Archaic Glyphs**</span>](/card/03193) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nI believe [the other version](/card/03192) is more popular, but this version is very satisfying to use as well.\r\n\r\nYou have to imagine moving the text \"This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity\" upfront since I think that is the main selling point of this one. \r\n\r\nRegardless of bunched up together or not, if you draw an enemy, you engaged with the enemy, and that mess up your turn order. The fighter sometimes have to stop at the other location to kill the doom-pumping enemy, for example. In that mean time, you as a Seeker probably can take off half of the clues and need 1 more turn to get the job done.\r\n\r\nNow you get an enemy. Normally, you cannot go first anymore and the fighter have to take some kind of compromise coming back to you. After that the fighter need to kill off the enemy right away to let you investigate as usual, or take the engagement away if he cannot. Risk of friendly-fire and whatnot.\r\n\r\nBut now you can go first and just <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> Investigate to your heart's content. If enemy got auto-evaded but the work is not done, fighter can come or not come. If coming, they can hit it without friendly-fire or Retaliate. If the enemy got auto-evaded and the work is done with an action remaining, you can casually walk away and let the reengaging enemy stick with the fighter instead.\r\n\r\nEasy location is turning into high chance of evasion, bypassing any <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> that the enemy has, and it works with Elite!\r\n\r\n[The other glass-cannon version](/card/03192) looks bonkers in efficiency, but an enemy, low commits, or \"unworthy\" location will greatly reduce the chance of going big with that one. Personally I love this version much more.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Charles Ross, Esq.**</span>](/card/03149) \r\n\r\nYou can \"bank\" the 1 resource discount by <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> exhaust him turns after turn, when you have nothing to play yet, since this effect says \"next\" without expiration. So don't forget to bank at least 2 so [Lantern](/card/03036) and [Flashlight](/card/01087) is reduced to 0. [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) will need 3 turns to reduce to 0.\r\n\r\nBy using the \"pay for others\" feature, you may want to stack more discounts on you for something bigger like <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> guns.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Charisma**</span>](/card/01694) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••</span>\r\n\r\nEssential to get your 6 allies cycling properly (together with [Calling in Favors](/card/03158)). Especially to enable having [Stray Cat](/card/01076) on stand by. \r\n\r\nAlso notice that [Charles Ross, Esq.](/card/03149) is quite tanky for his 2 cost. Having [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) + [Charles Ross, Esq.](/card/03149) is a good way to have [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) longer while the other guy gets hit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Close Call**</span>](/card/01583) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nUse [Archaic Glyphs](/card/03193) and [Stray Cat](/card/01076) to get an evasion for this card.\r\n\r\nBy the next time it came back from encounter set, you maybe able to get [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) equipped and kill it for good! Try this when you see the encounter deck is thin, bunch up together to \"lure\" it to the disc.\r\n\r\nAs the last resort, using [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) on herself can get to 5 <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span>. The other source of agility is on [Calling in Favors](/card/03158), so [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) is actually a good emergency card you should keep to play with [Close Call](/card/01083).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Disc of Itzamna**</span>](/card/01541) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nThis card is not bad for commit with her ability as it has an almost <span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> icons. You still have a chance to use [Scavenging](/card/01073) to get it back.\r\n\r\nIt works together with [Close Call](/card/01083) when the encounter deck is thin. The first time around you maybe not ready to \"disc\" and it spawned, but now that you sent it back, group up strategically to hit the disc can be effective.\r\n\r\nCard with \"same location\" is good for Minh as she wants to use the +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> quota for other investigators as often as possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**\"Look what I found!\"**</span>](/card/01579) \r\n\r\nEventually removed but before it is, you can make plays with [Lantern](/card/03036). [Lantern](/card/03036) reduces shroud so it may move the shroud to the range you can [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) easier.\r\n\r\nEspecially if it is 3 shroud location, which after reducing to 2 it is 100% that you can play [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) no matter how hard you fails, it is capped at 0 before the [\"Look what I found!\"](/card/01079) check.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**Cryptic Research**</span>](/card/01543) <span class=\"card-xp\">••••</span>\r\n\r\nThis classic card from core set looks like an \"expensive generic toy\" that rarely gets into the deck behind all other deck-specific cards. But for Minh it is actually synergistic as she wants to refill her hand to commit more.\r\n\r\nThis deck has 8 level zero skills that aren't touched at all, by having 2x [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) it is very possible to reset the deck quickly to use them again if used all on yourself. Also useful to quickly getting stuff to fix [The King in Yellow](/card/03011) as well.\r\n\r\nIt also fills in the draw engine void after [Rabbit's Foot](/card/01075) left the deck for [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041).\r\n\r\nCard with \"same location\" is good for Minh as she wants to use the +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> quota for other investigators as often as possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-seeker\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-seeker\">**No Stone Unturned**</span>](/card/03307) <span class=\"card-xp\">•••••</span>\r\n\r\nTalk with the team what would they like to get to set things up. If no one want stuff, getting [Analytical Mind](/card/03010) is a solid choice.\r\n\r\nI think 1 copy is enough as I would rather have 2x [Cryptic Research](/card/01043) first. If you need 1 more copy, then spend 5 XP more to replace the remaining [Lantern](/card/03036) or the remaining [Calling in Favors](/card/03158).\r\n\r\nCard with \"same location\" is good for Minh as she wants to use the +<span class=\"icon-wild\"></span> quota for other investigators as often as possible.",

(===================== TABLE END =====================)\r\n\r\n❂ : One copy left in the deck.\r\n\r\nUse the remaining XP to repurchase [A Test of Will](/card/03156) after using the Exile effect.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n\r\n- Use [On the Hunt](/card/03263) / [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022) to get an enemy to defeat, to recur items, and play [Bury Them Deep](/card/03016) / [Evidence!](/card/01022).\r\n- After some upgrades, you can recur better limited use items such as [.45 Automatic (2)](/card/03190) and [Police Badge](/card/01027). Focus on budgeting your resource and discard pile. For example, keep the 0 cost [Leather Coat](/card/01072) and [Cherished Keepsake](/card/03114) in the \"rotation\" for when you defeat an enemy (hard to control when) but is low on resource.\r\n- [Knife](/card/01086) is for 2 damages recursion with his ability, and also needed to bump out [.45 Automatic (2)](/card/03190) that is out of ammo to discard pile.\r\n- Try go for the [Police Badge](/card/01027) + [Will to Survive](/card/01085) combo to have a longer test-less turn. You can get [Will to Survive](/card/01085) back with [Resourceful](/card/03039), but look out for the 4 play cost.\r\n- [Emergency Cache](/card/01088) is not removed, but even upgraded at the end so it gives 4 resources. This is to support replaying expensive [.45 Automatic](/card/03190), [Police Badge](/card/01027) and [Will to Survive](/card/01085).\r\n- [True Survivor](/card/03273) to bring back all skill cards except [Vicious Blow](/card/01025).\r\n- Yorick's ability didn't say Item asset, therefore you can also revive [Beat Cop](/card/01018) that was used up. (Despite sounding totally opposite of a gravedigger's job..) So by saving up 4 resources you can keep pumping automatic damage. Remember that [Beat Cop](/card/01018) does not have <span class=\"icon-unique\"></span> constraint, it is possible to have 2 at the same time. (Once [Charisma](/card/01694) is added at the end.)\r\n- When you hit <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, any card can be revived, but to the hand. Solid choices are [Evidence!](/card/01022) and [Vicious Blow](/card/01025) which are usable from hand. They are unable to be revived with the regular ability or [Resourceful](/card/03039). But if you committed some skill cards in this very test you got <span class=\"icon-elder_sign\"></span>, you **cannot** get that skill card back. It is **not yet** in discard pile. (Kind of still in a \"[limbo](https://arkhamdb.com/rules#Limbo)\".)\r\n\r\n# Card tips\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Beat Cop**</span>](/card/01518), <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Beat Cop**</span>](/card/01528) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nVery important play to know is that if you use [Beat Cop](/card/01018)'s discard and that ended up killing the enemy, or you use [Beat Cop (2)](/card/01528)'s last health and that ended up killing the enemy, you **can** use Yorick's ability to bring the cop back as the reward of defeating the enemy (prepare 4 resources). You never have openings with no [Beat Cop](/card/01018) this way.\r\n\r\nIt works like this because before the `:` in the card description are costs which must be paid in full before anything could happen. Therefore the cop is in discard pile (allowing Yorick's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> to work) before the damage is happening, as weird as it sounds picturing bullet flying when the cop is already dead.\r\n\r\nCheck [William Yorick](/card/03005) review section and search for my name (5argon) for other cards that may or may not work like this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[<span class=\"fg-neutral\">**Knife**</span>](/card/01586) \r\n\r\n[Knife](/card/01086) is a famous weapon for Yorick since he can recover it the same hit that last shot the enemy, the clause \"Discard Knife\" came first in that fight action as a cost. By the time you defeat the enemy, you can use his ability to get it back **in play**. Remember to pay 1 resource as well.\r\n\r\nAnd 2 damages hit is more likely to KO the enemy, sometimes you throw it even if the enemy has 1 HP left since it has higher +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> accuracy. (This is kind of [Dig Deep](/card/01077) pumping without having [Dig Deep](/card/01077), since [Knife](/card/01086) replay cost is 1.)\r\n\r\nHe has starting 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>, so the knife throw ups the accuracy to 6 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and probably 7 with [Beat Cop](/card/01018) standing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**Police Badge**</span>](/card/01527) <span class=\"card-xp\">••</span>\r\n\r\nAt this point it is already obvious you replay this with Yorick's ability (prepare 3 resources as well). Try to keep it in mind whenever it is in discard pile (1 or 2 copies). Defeating any weak enemy may mean you gain actions to do insane stuff you initially don't think you would make it in time, like speedrunning to the Resign location.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**\"Not without a fight!\"**</span>](/card/03272) \r\n\r\nThis is a tricky card, looks like a way to add more [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) that is slightly worse because it needs an enemy.\r\n\r\nNote that while you need to be engaged with something, it can be committed to the **other** investigators. (Unlike [Rise to the Occasion](/card/02192) or [Stroke of Luck](/card/02271) in Dunwich set.) So this card gets a little tech if Yorick is the lead investigator, if he draws an enemy and is standing at the same location as others, then <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span><span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> or <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span><span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> may help with treachery defense on those who draws next. (You can use [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022) to gather more enemies in high player count.)\r\n\r\nIf you are in a miss-and-die situation (fighting heavy hitting Retaliate enemy, or fighting a boss on the last turn knowing that defeating it will end the scenario, etc.) you can attempt to summon more enemy with [On the Hunt](/card/03263) so [\"Not without a fight!\"](/card/03272) gains more icons. (You are pummelled if you let all the enemies into Enemy Phase, though!)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**On the Hunt**</span>](/card/03263) \r\n\r\nThis card requires deciding before you draw an encounter, so \"encounter set meta-knowledge\" helps here (especially if you are the person setting up the game).\r\n\r\nIf you remembered card count of each set (e.g. Ancient Evils = 3 cards) and you don't want to hit them knowing there are still a lot remaining, try using this. You will figure out similar unfavorable sets in Carcosa campaign that has cards Yorick don't want to get. I'll hint that it involves Item assets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span class=\"icon-survivor\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-survivor\">**Dig Deep**</span>](/card/01577) \r\n\r\nIt is an Asset, so also possible to commit away first to plan to play with Yorick's <span class=\"icon-reaction\"></span> instead to keep your tempo up. (Still need to prepare 2 resources.)\r\n\r\nIt boosts both treachery survival stat <span class=\"icon-agility\"></span> and <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> that Yorick has 3 on, maybe useful when facing difficulty 4 tests in combination with [Unexpected Courage](/card/01093) or [\"Not without a fight!\"](/card/03272).",

If at this point you can't get the research done, you may give up by removing them instead of [Eureka!](/card/03231) in the [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306) upgrades, keeping 2x [Eureka!](/card/03231) til the end.\r\n\r\n# Splashes\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**.32 Colt**</span>](/card/03020) \r\n\r\nDaisy with a Colt.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n2x <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-guardian\">**\"Let me handle this!\"**</span>](/card/03022) \r\n\r\nGet enemy to you from any location and punch it in the face with [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1x <span class=\"icon-mystic\"></span> [<span class=\"fg-mystic\">**Ward of Protection**</span>](/card/01565) \r\n\r\nAlways love the warm, fuzzy feeling of having this nope card on hand. Before [Bulletproof Vest](/card/01094) arrives, you will want to keep this to cancel the 2 damages / damage fail-by tests.\r\n\r\nYou can switch this with [Vicious Blow](/card/01025), it should be pretty good as a clutch 2 damage punch while the [.32 Colt](/card/03020) is not found, or to instakill 3 HP enemy with [.32 Colt](/card/03020).\r\n\r\n# How to hit the shot\r\n\r\n[.32 Colt](/card/03020) is a weapon with large amount of ammo and +1 damage but with no boost. We need to look at some temporary enablers that allows Daisy to hit the target. It sounds difficult, but it is similar to how you need to find [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) to get [Shrivelling](/card/01060) to hit in classic Daisy.\r\n\r\n- Mainly with [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) to hit at 6 <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> with [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033). This makes it better than the usual [Shrivelling](/card/01060) + [Holy Rosary](/card/01059) for Daisy, which requires 2 asset equips and lasts for not as long.\r\n- [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) can make the fight easier for yourself, or to support the real fighter.\r\n- Yes, 2x [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306) are essentially 3 + 3 XP just to replay 0 XP cards [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) and [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108). But they are badass with the gun.\r\n- [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) + [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) are both Fast. Together (easier assembled with [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306)) they can allow miracle round of Daisy dealing 6 damages if she is already engaged. Take care of your horror so [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) works. (Especially when deciding to fix [The Necronomicon](/card/01009).)\r\n- Try to get the omni +2 from [Fieldwork](/card/03024) by walking into the enemy. (Suitable for \"small fry\" with 1-2 fight with unexpectedly high HP, since Daisy would ended up at 4 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span>.) It can be easier if you put [Shortcut (2)](/card/03232) around. Also, 2x [Fieldwork](/card/03024) can add +4 instead for an accurate shot. The upgrade removes 1 copy of [Fieldwork](/card/03024) later.\r\n- Add some cash earned from [Dr. Milan Christopher](/card/01033) to [Scientific Theory](/card/03109), which ups <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> for the gun or ups <span class=\"icon-intellect\"></span> for your [Deduction](/card/01039) test. (Save some for playing 2 copies of [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) as well.)\r\n- Using [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) on yourself (requires not engaging with anything first).\r\n- [Archaic Glyphs (3)](/card/03193)'s evade can restore a moment that you can use free Tome action of [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) on yourself without AoO. You can add +2 <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> and strike back with the [.32 Colt](/card/03020) for the remaining 2 actions.\r\n\r\n# [The Necronomicon](/card/01009)\r\n\r\nWhen it comes, you may have to decide whether [.32 Colt](/card/03020) or [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) to fly away from your hand. Many times [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) is better gone if you have the <span class=\"icon-combat\"></span> enabler [Mind over Matter](/card/01036) / [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) / [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306) on hand. Resistance to enemy spawn is valuable to continue working and [.32 Colt](/card/03020) is equivalent to cancelling enemy draw. (And an enemy will lock down your free <span class=\"icon-action\"></span> on [Encyclopedia](/card/01042) too.) If you have [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) equipped then [.32 Colt](/card/03020) discard should be OK to keep [Encyclopedia](/card/01042).\r\n\r\nIt is quite troubling to justify fixing [The Necronomicon](/card/01009) in this deck when we have [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) (just 4 horror counters will disable it). With [.32 Colt](/card/03020) equipped, you better keep track of the amount of [Anatomical Diagrams](/card/03108) left in the deck before letting your horror over the threshold.\r\n\r\n# Other plays\r\n\r\n- 2x [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022) are there to combo with [Disc of Itzamna](/card/01041) if someone got an enemy draw, you can remotely pull the enemy to the disc and kill it. (It says \"encounter card\" which includes enemies, not just \"treachery card\") +2 can be helpful to help with <span class=\"icon-willpower\"></span> test as well.\r\n- If you have [Archaic Glyphs (3)](/card/03193) down you can also use [\"Let me handle this!\"](/card/03022) to get the enemy engagement, so you can perform auto-evade for the fighter. (This card has a FAQ clarify that \"engaged\" meant \"engaged with you\".)\r\n- [Fieldwork](/card/03024) boost expired in a phase. The phase is usually Investigation Phase. But with [Shortcut (2)](/card/03232) installed on a location (or scenario effect), you can <span class=\"icon-fast\"></span> Move in weird timing. Try look around if you need +2 in any other phase or not. (If you move in the test of Mythos Phase, that test had already begun, and so +2 will not apply and will wait for the \"next\" one, which is rare that you get 2 tests in Mythos Phase.)\r\n- [Eidetic Memory](/card/03306) can play that 1x copy of  [Logical Reasoning](/card/03191) to help your poor 5-6 sanity investigators in the late campaign. It can also play Insight of any investigators. For this card pool, you may try teaming up with <span class=\"icon-rogue\"></span> to play their [Sure Gamble](/card/01056) to hit your shots. (The card does not looks like it is an Insight but it is.) Also maybe cool with <span class=\"icon-guardian\"></span>'s [Evidence!](/card/01022).",
