# What is it

Standard size sleeves commonly comes in various opaque colors with either glossy or matte back. They are popular in other CCG / competitive card games for great shuffling feel, and even required to enter official tournaments (perhaps so it is easier to see if someone marked the back of card than patterned card back).

AHLCG is known for creatively use the back side of the card, as well as liberally getting dynamic with the card types. This make clear sleeves (perfect fit or standard size) preferred more than opaque colored sleeves common to CCG, to handle any strange ideas the game designers thrown at us. (Plus, this game has beautiful card back artwork!)

However, in many scenarios, there are common pattern of some cards that game designer wanted to use it to situationally spice up the gameplay. The setup guide often asked you to set aside these cards so it could make an entry (by surprise of whoever not setting up the scenario) later on. These cards are safe to sleeve in opaque back.

This is a guide that tell you which cards to sleeve in opaque colored back for each product that could enhance gameplay. It also count them so you can plan your purchase.

# Spoiler warning

This ultimately is subjective, and requires scenario knowledge to determine color sleeving which card would result in better experience.

The card getting color sleeved are often the surprise or boss enemy, reading this guide will obviously spoil you a lot.

It is designed for players already run a couple times and had seen all the mechanics, and wanted to improve replay experience.

# Why sleeve in different colors

- Improve setup time, because the scenario always ask you to find it to set aside.
- Improve teardown time. It is even better if you used dividers, because you can clearly see the color of it top down looking into the box to make sure you didn’t lose that card.
- It can even be used to divide different type of cards inside the same divider set. (Such as location cards, one Elite enemy with colored sleeve act as mini-divider, then normal encounter cards follows, all are inside the same set but requires separating on setup. Now you can grab the encounter portion and location portion easily without scanning the cards to setup faster.
- Reduce confusion while playing when the play field is crowded, since it is obviously highlighted.. Often these special cards are Elite enemy, and it could get confusing when normal enemies/its minions spawned to the mix while you are beating it up. (Especially when the artwork has similar color.)
- Categorize set aside cards so you can bring in the right set when the scenario ask for it, on scenario with multiple staged set aside cards designed to gradually coming into play.
- Make the important cards tactile, granting them different texture when touching them. The game designer can use artwork but cannot break the card’s physical boundary, sleeves allows you do do so!
Purchase guide
- Anti-glare sleeve is not recommended, since it frost the front side and dulls the color. An example is Dragon Shield sleeves with “Non Glare” on the box, or Ultra Pro “Pro Matte” series.
- Try finding manufacturer that sell in lower count than 100 so you can have more colors for less. Dragon Shield came with many colors but unfortunately only a box of 100, for example.

# About colors

The guide uses “Color A”, “Color B”, etc. and so on without specifying a specific color. These are intended so it account for when multiple colored cards are on the field altogether, the color won’t clash and cause another kind of confusion. You can use any color you like.

Though, personally I think you should stick with color that is not so vibrant since scenario cards in this game generally has moody, brown-ish tone. Only player cards are vibrantly colored per class.

I also enjoy matching the color of sleeve with the artwork of Elite enemy when possible, if I have a matching colored sleeve.

“Color A1”, “Color A2” meant you can use the same color since they won’t clash, but could be different as well for style.

# Night of the Zealot

Color A : 5
Color B : 1

## Color A

- Cult of Umordhoth : 5x Cultists
   - These are set aside and spawn at your request or by story.
   - Sometimes we kind of forgot the already spawned Cultist but it was too far away. Having color helps remind us of the mission while fighting the other stuff.
   - However you cannot sleeve The Masked Hunter!

## Color B

- Devourer Below : Umordhoth

Note : You cannot sleeve Ghoul Priest, since it is possible that it would be shuffled into the encounter deck.

# Edge of the Earth

Color A1 : 3
Color A2 : 4
Color A3 : 15
Color B1 : 9
Color B2 : 9

## Color A1

- The Crash : Terror of the Stars
- To the Forbidden Peaks : Terror of the Stars
- City of the Elder Things : Terror of the Stars
   - These are all the same recurring bad guy the scenario ask you to set aside.

## Color A2

- Seeping Nightmares : 4x Seeping Nightmare
   - They start in play immediately.
   - We really got confused with spawned Skittering Nonsense at some point. Having colored sleeve kind of help.
   - It helps seeing the location that we have to attack easier, especially when location treacheries starts attaching at various location and enemy scattered around, making it not so obvious of the Seeping Nightmare’s location.

## Color A3

- Stirring in the Deep : 15x The Nameless Madness
   - Reduce confusion with the other enemies with similarly colored artwork.
   - Greatly helps determining possible spawn location because you see more clearly which locations are occupied.

## Color B1

- Expedition Team : 9x Partner assets
   - We often mistakenly shuffle these into the deck after finished playing. This make it obvious that there is a colored card inside the deck when making this mistake.
   - In a deck with multiple Ally assets, this is a nice way to highlight the Partner one on your side.
   - It is helpful for the other teammates trying to see how healthy the Partner is, when the field has a lot of damage/horror tokens on multiple assets. Other players often have to look at cards upside down and it being highlighted kind of help.

## Color B2

- Fatal Mirage : 9x Resolute Partner assets
   - The same reason as regular Partner asset, but if you use different color you can show off the evolution clearer how OP your partner is, having strengthened the resolve.
   - Contrary to Expedition Team set, these cards are mixed with regular Fatal Mirage set. The game have you pick them out throughout any other scenarios and it can get annoying having to scan Fatal Mirage set every time for them. Seeing them in color in the campaign box helps locating them easier.
   - Let you put back the member in the right place, if your team uses a mix of Resolute and regular Partner.

# Murder at the Excelsior Hotel
