# What is a "Starter Deck"?

In collectible card game, "preconstructed deck" / "starter deck" is a whole deck with clear theme you can **buy** in one unit and be ready to play with others. So you don't have to open many booster packs when you first get into the game and since they are randomized, you may not even get staple cards to create a functional deck.

In Arkham Horror : The Card Game, FFG also did similar idea : "Investigator Starter Deck". All these decks are single color and ready to play, comes with a unique investigator and some cards you can't find anywhere else. Other than this, you are expected to build decks from a collection of cards you own.

This game doesn't have booster packs, you get a fixed amount of all the cards in one Investigator Expansion to build all kind of decks. This site wants to turn the **first few** Investigator Expansion new players bought into many viable "starter deck" that they can easily assemble and get into the game to temporarily bypass deckbuilding aspect, as if they bought a starter deck in collectible card game.

## Most important : Maximum of 3 expansions

The appeal of collectible card game starter deck is one small unit of purchase with many synergistic cards jam-packed. This game however doesn't hand out cards like candies, the most granular unit of player card purchase is a much bigger **Investigator Expansion** (MSRP 45$). Revised Core Set is already MSRP 60$, and a Campaign Expansion is MSRP 70$. One each, and the game starts "for real" at MSRP 175$. From beginner's perspective, they better have many options from this amount of investment.

The more expansions a deck touches, the more "deck cost" adds up in a chunk of 45$, making it less appealing for beginners. You can easily see many highly rated decks in arkhamdb.com costing (virtually) 200$ and more, since they uses all the best tiny bit from each Investigator Expansion.
  
I want many decks to show up as buildable in this site as soon as a player purchases 1 or 2 Investigator Expansion, **no matter what that expansion is**. Therefore this restriction is the most important identity of this site. Search tool is upfront and geared for **expansion-based search**. Decks that managed to use **fewer expansions** will get better exposure because the search hits them more often.

I also want to prove that one absolutely do not have to buy Dunwich Investigator Expansion first. This common opinion "Dunwich is a staple!" leads to new player having to buy 2 Investigator Expansions successively to even begin getting into the game (Dunwich + something), in addition to a Campaign Expansion box since Night of the Zealot is not the real deal (this one I agree), and then they may not even like the game in the end with this 200$+ chunk of investment. I hope many decks in this site that does not have Dunwich icon stuck on them can open up many more options so **any** first Investigator Expansion works for newcomers.

The investigator card used in the deck also counted as coming from that entire Investigator Expansion in the quota. So deckbuilders are encouraged to make use of all the cards that comes with that investigator as much as possible to not bump up the cost of the deck.
  
If a deck uses **Investigator Starter Deck**, that also count as 1 expansion (though virtual cost added is cheaper, at MSRP 17$).

**Parallel Investigator** cards are free to print-and-play and therefore are all usable without restriction. Anything not costing more into this already expensive game is encouraged.

## Party assembler tool

This game is often played up to 3-4 players using a single set of collection. This is tied to the cost, and therefore beginner friendliness of the game.

Therefore I think it is a good function of this site to allow players to **build a team** from many starter decks and show if they are not using the same cards.
