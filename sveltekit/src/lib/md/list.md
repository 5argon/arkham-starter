# Card List

This tool is almost like the [Upgrade Planner](/guide-tools/upgrade), but it is a single column instead of two, therefore it has all functions related to differentiating the XP removed.

The biggest difference is on the export modal. The point of this tool is that you want to do something "for each" card in a way that is not restricted to table format.

For example, simply export a list of card names that is formatted like the card list in ArkhamDB. After pasting, you can continue editing it to say something about each card.
