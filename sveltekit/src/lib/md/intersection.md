# Team Intersection Tool

This tool let you specify multiple teams, one team consisting of up to 4 arkhamdb.com decks. Then, you are able to find **intersection of cards** of any pair of 2 teams. Each entry shows a card, plus the "left" and "right" side, each side showing which investigator and whether it lands in main deck or Side Deck of that investigator.

The situation to use this tool is when you need to switch between multiple concurrent campaigns (of potentially differing party size). The thing preventing you to have concurrent decks across different campaigns is going to be card overlaps. Now, you have some mental gymnastic to do. Is the overlap a lot, or only a few cards? Should I dissolve all the decks instead of handpicking overlaps? Or should I proxy some overlapping cards?

Though you have everything recorded digitally on arkhamdb.com or ArkhamCards app, it takes time to gather enough information to execute the campaign swap. The intersection result give you more visual insights before you decide which approach you want to go with.

## Example

I am running Dunwich campaign using Zoey and Rex. Zoey is using 2x Blinding Light in her splash cards, and Rex of course is using 2x Deduction. Suddenly I got a visit and we want to play NotZ together using FFG Starter Deck for this night, as Roland, Daisy, Agnes team.

By using the intersection tool between [Zoey, Rex] vs. [Roland, Daisy, Agnes] teams, the result would show : 

- [Zoey] 1x Blinding Light [Daisy]
- [Zoey] 1x Blinding Light [Agnes]
- [Rex] 1x Deduction [Roland]
- [Rex] 1x Deduction [Daisy]
- ...

With this result recorded, you precisely know how to move cards from-to teams and land on the right deck, and back when NotZ game is over, without completely destroying Zoey and Rex decks just to have one night of NotZ game. 

Also it let you work on the swap faster by having better pipeline. You iterate Zoey and Rex decks first and pick all the cards to take out, and then assemble the NotZ deck on top of those cards you just took. It is faster than try building the NotZ deck first, then realize the collection is missing some cards, which is in use in either Zoey or Rex deck, then having to find it, and repeat.
