# Starter deck criterias

Decks in `arkham-starter.com` has several restrictions on them, otherwise ArkhamDB is the best place to publish your deck.

The main point is that as a "starter deck", they should not require too many purchases under the new distribution model and provide some general idea to play the deck. Some experienced player just see the deck list and understand how to play, but not beginners.

## No more than 2 Investigator Expansions

This is the most strict criteria of this site. **In addition to** the Revised Core Set, you can use 2 more Investigator Expansions. That means if the investigator used didn't came from Revised Core Set, it already took 1 of the 2 Investigator Expansion slot you have.

With this restriction, this site has its niche to be a reliable place for players just starting out to find something to play without being forwarded to pay more and more.

## Optionally 1 Investigator Starter Deck

Things works differently for Investigator Starter Deck, since they are not as expensive as a box of Investigator Expansion. It maybe reasonable for newcomers to have a few boxes of these along with their Investigator Expansion purchase.

You can choose to use 1 Investigator Starter Deck in addition to 2 Investigator Expansions, **however** note that search tool of this site is heavily optimized for filtering by Investigator Expansions. By choosing to use an Investigator Starter Deck, your deck will have reduced audience if the player filter using just Investigator Expansions but not also ticking the Investigator Starter Deck.

## Side Deck for upgrades

Your deck must express upgrade cards using the Side Deck section, and the deck is what it looks like at Scenario 1. You can attach the "final form" deck, but at least the main entry must be structured like so.

Side Deck can include all the different suggestions for upgrades, or even for swapping in the Scenario 1 deck. It is not required that all cards in the Side Deck must be used in the plan.

## Deck guide

You should write a guide to play the deck in your ArkhamDB page. This site will **not** import your guide but will display a button to forward user to ArkhamDB to read your guide. This maybe just 1 or 2 paragraphs, not required to be a long article.

## No Story Cards

In ArkhamDB, you can build the deck using any cards, including story cards. They will show up as unknown in this site because the database doesn't even have them. Deck using campaign cards will not show up in this site.

## Attachments

Other than a link to your deck in ArkhamDB, this site allows adding in several new data, independent of ArkhamDB :

- Deck name : You may used to add "(Deck Guide)" or something in the name or the packs used to improve visibility. Since this site show them in the UI by default, you can type in a new name for your deck to be different from original.
- Upgrade guide : By using the Upgrade Planner tool, you get an "import code" that can be attached to your deck. They will be rendered nicely along with the deck.
- Excerpt : You can type a short paragraph that would be displayed near the button to go to ArkhamDB page. It only accepts plain text. Type something that makes the viewer wants to learn more about your deck.

## Revised Core Set Forwarding

You can use either Core Set or Revised Core Set cards in ArkhamDB, as they are treated as different entries. However when they show up in this site, everything are forwarded to Revised Core Set to reduce confusion for beginners.

This also means this site assume all players has Revised Core Set bonus cards such as Lockpicks (1).
