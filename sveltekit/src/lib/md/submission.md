# Submitting your starter decks

Currently, all the decks are hand-curated from  and hard-coded into the site. Tools to submit the decks on your own are in development and also requires requesting some special credential from the author of ArkhamDB, so you can login to ArkhamDB in this site and choose your published deck you want to share here.

For now, PM me your published deck URL using one of the contacts I listed at the bottom of page and I will sort that out for you.

## Submission process (once that is possible)

This website is weird that it stubbornly insisted on being static. Even if you submitted your deck, the site is not automatically updated to show your deck until I **rebuild** the site manually.

I have a tooling that checks and rebuild the site once per day if anyone submitted a new deck. So please wait until the next day to see the changes.
