# Starter deck criterias

All decks on arkham-starter.com is a **subset of** decks in arkhamdb.com. Each entry also links to the original deck at arkhamdb.com instead of outright copying it. So this site works like an aggregator, viewers are still forwarded to the original page that the author could receive comments and likes.

However, there are several restrictions that qualifies a deck for this site, otherwise this site would be identical to arkhamdb.com! The name "starter" is intended that these decks are all a "starter deck", meaning that they are :

- **Economical :** It must limits amount of purchases, regarding the repackaged format. It make use of what's available to the fullest as opposed to picking the best pieces from across an entire collections. Right now, a unit of purchase is Revised Core Set, Investigator Expansion box, and the Starter Deck. We don't think about old Mythos Packs in this site.
- **Guided :** Often, decks in arkhamdb.com are very brief in explaining how to play the deck as the author assumes player looking at the decklist and know what combos are available, and know what to do for any combination that they draw. Especially if there are fan favorite cards among them that defines the play style.

  That does not work for beginners that do not even know effects of each card. Decks here must put more effort in writing a guide such that even a complete beginner (that know basic rules) can play the deck. More obscure rules that is related to the function of the deck must be explained in the deck guide.
- **Ready to start a campaign with :** In arkhamdb.com, there are many decks that lists the final state. Beginners cannot reverse engineer these decks on their own how would the 0 XP version looks like. We enforce a rule that the starting deck must require 0 XP, or exactly the bonus XP that the investigator or some cards like In The Thick Of It could provide. Then, the Side Deck section is used to hold the upgrade cards. Which card to remove when upgrading the deck is expressed separately with the attached upgrade guide.

## Pack Restriction

Any deck can use Revised Core Set. Additionally, it could use **up to 2 Investigator Expansion boxes**. (This includes the investigator of that deck.) Optionally, it could opt in to use **1 Starter Deck**. Parallel Investigators can be used freely as they are free to print.

Return To product are not eligible for use, as they are not economical.

The browsing page, filtering, searching, and structure of this site are optimized for this restriction. For example, starting from any deck, you can search for an another deck to play together that does not require any additional purchases and has no overlapping cards.

### The Badge

To highlight this system even more, each deck will receive a badge that categorize the deck how many packs the deck uses :

- `1` : Using only Revised Core Set.
- `1S` : Revised Core Set + 1 Starter Deck.
- `2` : Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion.
- `2S` : Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion + 1 Starter Deck.
- `3` : Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansions.
- `3S` : Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansions + 1 Starter Deck.

These badges have their use when the player is just starting out. For example, viewers that just bought a Revised Core Set may filter with `1` to find what to play, then maybe take a peek at `2` option to browse what decks are available to play if they buy which Investigator Expansion box next, without any Starter Deck in the equation.

These badges also encourage deck creator to not "waste" a pack's inclusion, for example, using only a few good cards from a Starter Deck, since that would cause the badge to gain `S` suffix. From deck creator's standpoint this optimizes the deck, but for beginner's standpoint it meant he must additionally buy a Starter Deck in order to complete this deck's missing piece.

## Deck Guide

I hope you write a good guide at the original page at arkham.db, but there is no human to check these. This site places a simple restriction that the text must be over 1000 characters.

Additionally, you can write a new **excerpt** that only appears on this site. It should get the viewer excited to go to your original page at arkhamdb.com.

### Upgrade Guide

By using the Upgrade Planner tool on this site, you can get a Markdown text that can be embedded in arkhamdb.com's description section.

Entries in this site can also display an export code from Upgrade Planner to show separately as well, so viewer can take a peek at the recommended upgrade path before going to the original page at arkhamdb.com.

Deck can additionally provide alternate upgrade guides. You can use this to show the standalone version that hits close to 19 XP, 29 XP breakpoint, etc.
