# Deck Gather

This is a tool to help you bring out the cards from your collection for all players that had built their own deck in ArkhamDB. Improving campaign setup speed and as a host, remove the need to teach every players how you ordered your collection.

It merges all the decks together into a single big list, then you are able to sort it according to the shape of your collection and gather cards for everyone **in one go**. A label is appended to each entry telling you which player they are for, so you can set them aside to the right stack for that player.

For this tool to be able to read the deck from its URL, make sure the owner of that deck checked in the user settings so that unpublished decks are public. For published deck, this tool can always read it.

Even with 1 deck, it provide quite a lot more flexible grouping and sorting than that of ArkhamDB. This increase the chance of the ordering to match with how you organize your collection.

## Deck Overlap

This area warns you when multiple players used the same cards too much it exceeds quantity provided in the collection. The tool assumes you owns 1 box of every release. (There is no Core Set, only 1x Revised Core Set.)

You can then may decide to proxy these cards if they are not too many.
