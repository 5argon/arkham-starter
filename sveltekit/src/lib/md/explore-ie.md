# Explore Investigator Expansions

Page at `/explore/[pack-code-name]` are special case of the `/explore` page. (See documentation of the regular Explore page for details.) It is focused in viewing content of repackaged **Investigator Expansion** box.

The reason I made this :

- From The Scarlet Keys onwards FFG seems to remove the QR Code to view the content inside behind the box. (Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion was the last one with it.) I want to restore that sort of feature with these pages.
- For the repackaged box like The Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion, old QR code works, but still only showing the content of old distribution format. (Mythos Pack must be viewed one by one, and you would get spoiled the campaign cards!)
- arkhamdb.com is stuck with legacy format with separated Mythos Pack blister boxes. Though that site could view by cycle, I want it to be less confusing by eliminating Mythos Packs names altogether and having only "Investigator Expansion" wording. (e.g. There is no longer a card coming from "The Essex County Express".)
- Often I see players obtaining the game second hand and wanted to check for lost cards, this page should help doing so by also displaying collector's number and **quantity** of each card. Each row **can be toggled** for the purpose of counting cards as well.
- It can group in multiple layers, then sort in multiple layers. This may benefit players just purchased the box and wanted to sort differently from what the box gives you.
- Use it to get some ideas to build decks or selecting an investigator focusing on one expansion box, by roughly looking at all the cards.
- Use grouping and sorting to explore the bias of the expansion. (e.g. Whether it has a lot of level 0 cards or not.)
- It is quite mobile friendly.

All other advantages of regular Explore page remains, such as showing full scans by default.

## Official QR Codes

If you prefer, these are all the a QR codes on the back of product box that would reveal all the cards in it. Beware that old distribution format Mythos Pack would **spoil the campaign cards**.
