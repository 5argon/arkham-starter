# Explore (Investigator Expansion)

Page at `/explore/[pack-code-name]` are special case of the `/explore` page. (See documentation of the regular Explore page for details.) It is focused in viewing content of repackaged Investigator Expansion box.

The reason I made this :

- arkhamdb.com is stuck with legacy format with separated Mythos Pack blister boxes. Though that site could view by cycle, I want it to be less confusing by eliminating Mythos Packs altogether and having "Investigator Expansion" wording directly.
- From The Scarlet Keys onwards FFG seems to remove the QR Code to view the content inside behind the box. (Edge of the Earth Investigator Expansion was the last one with it.) I want to restore that sort of feature with these pages.
- Often I see players obtaining the game second hand and wanted to check for lost cards, this page should help doing so by also displaying collector's number and **quantity** of each card. Each row **can be toggled** for the purpose of counting cards as well.
- It can group in multiple layers, then sort in multiple layers. This may benefit players just purchased the box and wanted to sort differently from what the box gives you.
- Use it to get some ideas to build decks focusing on one expansion box.
- Use grouping and sorting to explore the bias of the expansion. (e.g. Whether it has a lot of level 0 cards or not.)
- It is quite mobile friendly.

All other advantages of regular Explore page remains, such as showing full scans by default.
