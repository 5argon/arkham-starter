# Collection Simulator

This tool knows all **player cards** in the game. You can choose which set you want to include instead of an entire game. It can simply list them out, however, the real power is in its **infinite level of grouping and sorting**. (Choose from available options.) For example, it is possible to tell it to group by Set > Class > Type then sort by Name.

It also have some binder organization support, such as showing which page and which pocket a card would lands on. However I am not a binder person so it may not be sufficient to your need. If there is something lacking, please let me know using contacts on the bottom of this site.

Effectively this simulates how your purchases looks like in your storage of choice and your organization algorithm of choice. It also take account of quantity of cards provided in the box, thanks to that data being available in ArkhamDB card database.

## New distribution model transformation

This `arkham-starter.com` website has its final goal to be a site of newcomer's resource. To achieve that, it went all-in to the new distribution model.

This page is affected by that decision :

- Core Set does not exist (and also no 2x Core Set), only 1x Revised Core Set exists. Quantity is based on Revised Core Set. (e.g. You have 2x .45 Automatic, and 10x Knife.)
- There is no individual Mythos Pack. You must either include or exclude an entire Investigator Expansion.
- Unreleased Investigator Expansion exist right now in this site, for forward compatibility. (e.g. "The Innsmouth Conspiracy Investigator Expansion" that FFG hasn't released just yet.)
