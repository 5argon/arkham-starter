# Campaign Switching Tool

This tool let you specify 2 ongoing campaigns, one campaign consists of up to 4 arkhamdb.com decks 

- Active Campaign : It assumes that cards from your collection are pulled out to make the decks of Active Campaign as much as possible.
- Inactive Campaign : Take all the leftover cards in the collection after building all the Active Campaign decks. These decks are likely incomplete and waiting for some hot cards to continue playing.

Then it assume all other cards are stored in your collection. (So imagine you have 3 different groups of cards here.)

This tool reveals you how to **switch from Active Campaign to Inactive Campaign** without dissolving all the decks back to collection first, by telling you to pick cards from which of the left deck (and also whether it is from main or side deck) to land on which of the right deck. In other words, it shows an intersection of 2 campaigns (up to 4 decks vs. 4 decks).

It is also useful to know if the switch is too much and you would rather dissolve all the decks back to collection.

## Example

I am running Dunwich campaign using Zoey and Rex. Zoey is using 2x Blinding Light in her splash cards, and Rex of course is using 2x Deduction. Suddenly I got a visit and we want to play NotZ together using FFG Starter Deck for this night, as Roland, Daisy, Agnes team.

By using the tool with Active Campaign = [Zoey, Rex] vs. Inactive Campaign (i.e. What I am going to switch to) = [Roland, Daisy, Agnes] teams, the result would show : 

- [Zoey] 1x Blinding Light [Daisy]
- [Zoey] 1x Blinding Light [Agnes]
- [Rex] 1x Deduction [Roland]
- [Rex] 1x Deduction [Daisy]
- ...

With this result recorded, you precisely know how to move cards from-to teams and land on the right deck, and back when NotZ game is over, without completely destroying Zoey and Rex decks just to have one night of NotZ game. 

Also it let you work on the swap faster by having better pipeline. You iterate Zoey and Rex decks first and pick all the cards to take out, and then assemble the NotZ deck on top of those cards you just took. It is faster than try building the NotZ deck first, then realize the collection is missing some cards, which is in use in either Zoey or Rex deck, then having to find it, and repeat.
