After Fantasy Flight Games made the [Revised Core Set](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-the-card-game/) and is repackaging previously released expansions to be more accessible, the game is getting a lot more influx of new players. I was among those players feeling welcomed by the Revised Core Set to get into the game.

This is an exciting time to create more helping contents for this game so the community could grow easier.

[arkham-starter.com](/) aims to compliment [ArkhamDB](https://arkhamdb.com/)'s wealth of knowledge, but is specialized for newcomers into the series. A dedicated URL "arkham-starter" reduce complications of going to a specific page inside ArkhamDB or entering a specific query. The name also suggests that one will find ready-to-use "starter decks" in here, but I will piggyback other beginner's resources into this site as well. (For "starting" players.)

**Currently, the site is WIP.** Big part of the site is planned to be the reimagined "beginner's decklist" section, which curates decks from ArkhamDB with restriction that it uses low pack count to build and have a guide to play it. These decks will receive beginner-friendly presentation both in the listing page and the inside, such as being more graphical and has more overview insight of the deck. (e.g. The decision made regarding to that investigator's deckbuilding options, which helps beginners so they don't have to decipher the decklist themself.)

Moreover, this site is tuned to the new distribution model to reduce beginner's confusion about the product. So much as pretending as if the Mythos Pack didn't exist. This means everything about Core Set is redirected to Revised Core Set, and there is only "The Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion" instead of an individual pack like "The Essex County Express" when talking about where a card belongs to.

On technical side, this site has a heavy restriction that it must be a static site and does not require any "active" server to run. This is both for my personal learning/challenge and make the site faster to use for you as well. (It also make some rich features presented in ArkhamDB impossible to replicate, unfortunately.)

Right now, it has only "guide tools" that aids writing the note section when you build the deck in ArkhamDB. These are actually test bed for UI components I planned to use in the finished site. You can try using them for now : 

- [Upgrade Planner](/tool/upgrade)
- [Card List](/tool/list)
