# Proxy Template

Download and print these copier-friendly card frames to take care of your overlapping cards!

- The pixel size of individual images has no meaning. **Please scale on your own** on your printing software.
- Recommended to lay them out on A4 paper with varying amount of skill icon frames as you like, then photocopy it to multiply.
- Five pips are all white, so you need to fill in black from the right to decrease the level.
- If you are going to insert in front of a genuine card inside a sleeve, make sure you print a bit smaller than an actual card size.
- You can also print just the 0 skill icon frame version and draw the frame yourself over the graphic, or print only the 4 frames one and draw less icons. But personally I think the frame is an important visual and I would like them match the amount of icons, so I made separate graphic for each.

## Premade A4 PDF

If you don't want to use layout software, you can just send these files to print shop and pick the one you want after cutting.

## Cards which often overlaps

This is only from personal experience. I often build limited expansion decks, and they are very likely to overlap with each other.
