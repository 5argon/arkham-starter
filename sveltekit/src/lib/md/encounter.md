# Encounter Set Quick Reference

If you search "Arkham Horror Encounter Set Usage" or similar, you will find spread sheets or tables that many community members have made, and passed over, over the years. This shows a quick overview of encounter set used in varying granularity. Some show an entire game, some has one campaign per sheet.

These has many purposes, including :

- Want to know what are needed for an entire campaign run.
- Want to gather the cards ahead of reading the story, due to storage "logistics".
- Want to setup the for the next time right at the end of today's session.
- Want to see the overall encounter set usage statistics.

However, players come and go. Many sheets has editing disabled, and the player that stopped playing the game won't have time to maintain it anymore. The forked version is made because someone want to continue, or just that the visualization is not to their liking.

So I made a yet another version. These are my reasons :

- I don't want to keep a Google Sheet URL, I want it accessible from URL I can remember (that is, my own site).
- Google Sheets are often massive and not mobile friendly. I want to be able to reference quickly from tiny mobile phone screen without much scrolling around. (Especially, not too much horizontal scrolling.)
- I have my own preference of how I want to see the data. Mainly, I want to be able to hide all the texts once I got used to the campaign and make it minimal, but also can toggle them back when I want to.
- I want the loading performance to be better than Google Sheets.

By programming a web application, I can make the data shift around in presentation as opposed to be completely static in Google Sheets. Also I have more confidence of maintaining it now that everything are automatically generated from a central source of "campaign database" in the code, not that I hand-place every icons in the cell like in Google Sheets.
