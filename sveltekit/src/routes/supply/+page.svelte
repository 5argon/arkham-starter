<p>
	You can print and use these cards when "shop scene" in The Forgotten Age campaign occurs. Instead
	of one player having to read out each item's description and their cost, you can just laid out
	these cards and let players pick what they want to get. Plus they can keep the cards with them to
	show off what they have while playing.
</p>

<p>
	They are made using official card's Asset frame with AI generated image. The bleed is enough for
	both mini-card cut and standard card cut when their vertical edge touches the oval frame like a
	normal Asset card.
</p>
<p>
	As for the card's back, I think it is better functionally to have the same content on both back
	and front. But if you want an opaque back, I also have made a special card back from collage of
	recolored official graphics.
