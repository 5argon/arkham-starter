# Deck criterias

## Allowed card pool

The biggest problem for beginners is that many decks in ArkhamDB are minmaxed and use cards from an entire collection, which is surely fun to build but they are impossible to follow for newcomers. Though you can craft a query to show possible decks from your limited card pool, it is not intuitive and has many gotchas. 

Therefore this site has this most important restriction : In addition to a Revised Core Set, it only allows up to : 

- 2 more Investigator Expansion boxes
- 1 more Investigator Starter Deck
- Any official print and play material (Parallel Investigators).

The filter UI when browsing the deck is heavily designed with this constraint in mind.

From that card pool constrint, the following 6 possible combinations will receive special treatment in this site (such as a dedicated tab) :

- Only Revised Core Set.
- Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion.
- Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansions.
- Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Starter Deck.
- Revised Core Set + 1 Investigator Expansion + 1 Investigator Starter Deck.
- Revised Core Set + 2 Investigator Expansion + 1 Investigator Starter Deck.

Using Parallel Investigator front or back will also be classified and possible to be filtered by visitor.

## Prohibited cards

These are considered too advanced for beginners and cannot be used : 

- Player cards in Return To boxes.
- Novella and other promotional cards.

## Other constraints

- Deck must be legal.
- Deck must always use the latest taboo available at that time, to ensure the deck works ubiquitously with or without taboo. Beginners can then decide to remove the taboo if they wish to make it easier for them. This is rather than the other way around (to enable the taboo manually) which will render some deck unusable. For example :
  - A deck with starting 2x Machete at the first scenario is not legal with taboo enabled. This deck should include In The Thick of It to make it possible in taboo play or move Machete into the upgrade. If beginners decided to not use the taboo, then they get 3 XP free to use as they wish or just remove In The Thick of It on their own.
  - A deck with Higher Education and 2x Pathfinder assuming they cost original amount of XP (3 + 1 + 1 = 5) may be too XP prohibitive with taboo enabled (6 + 3 + 3 = 12). The accompanying guide should always assume tabooed XP is needed, and not include too many more cards in the upgrade list.
  - A deck with Dr. Milan Christopher cannot assume abundance of resources to include high amount of costly cards.
- The deck must have an accompanying guide. The guide teach beginners what is to look for while playing the deck and how to upgrade. The author should assume that viewer may have no experience in card game combos. Upgrade guide maybe tight or loose as desired, as upgrading will in the end depends on campaign situation as well.
- The deck must consist of entirely of cards that the investigator would start with on the 1st scenario, rather than the "end game state". Upgrade cards can be expressed in the guide, in the side deck, or both.
