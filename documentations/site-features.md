# Site features

## Only a curator, always forward to ArkhamDB

This site intentionally **not** showing all of the guide included in the deck, and visitor must follow to the original ArkhamDB page to read an entire guide. This is because of concern that if this site shows everything, the author would not be able to receive thanks, comments for improvements, and likes, as would be the case in ArkhamDB after a visitor finished reading the guide and find a comment box afterwards.

Combined with a hard rule that deck must include a guide, this should ensure the "main" page of the deck is at ArkhamDB, not this site.

Author can control what snippet of an entire guide is pulled to here by a special syntax they can include at the bottom of deck description.

## Transformed card pool

ArkhamDB is a "database" and has the most granular unit as each mythos packs, and also must account for encounter cards as well. This data organization is appropriate for that site but could be specialized by transforming them to be more suitable to new repackaged format.

The site act as if old release format never existed, by providing some mapping or alias to ArkhamDB's database.

For example, there is no "The Miskatonic Museum" pack anymore but rather "Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion". It also transforms all Core Set card IDs from ArkhamDB to Revised Core Set equivalent. The expanded cards of Revised Core Set is also preferred. e.g. Including Charisma from either then Dunwich cycle or Revised Core Set in ArkhamDB are all forwarded to Revised Core Set.

## Rich deck listing

Packs required is not visible in ArkhamDB forcing deck authors to include such information in the title. For beginners the boxes required is as important as everything else as they want to try what they could build.

The listing here heavily use icons based of that cycle, so beginners can see at glance which deck they could or could not build. The search and filter tool is also tuned for beginners.

The listing also offers a peek into the deck in an interesting way with many hard-coded enhancements, such as whether a deck is using deckbuilding permanents such as Underworld Support or not or choice chosen for the deckbuilding options.

Deck author is able to choose up to 3 representative cards from the deck to be shown in the listing along with the artwork of that investigator. This can communicate to the visitor at a glance the idea of this deck, especially if it aims to have fun with janky cards.

## To-the-point deck name

Deck author no longer have to include a lot of "metadata" in the deck name such as "starter deck", "deck guide", "beginner", packs required, or even the character's name, as this entire site is already dedicated to these topics and will provide enough UI to describe your deck.

The original deck in ArkhamDB can keep the metadata-ed name for better presentation there. Instead, it can read a special text with specific formatting in the deck description in ArkhamDB for a shorter name to use here.

## Set decks

AHLCG is a fun game in groups, and we can take the ready-to-play experience of this site to the next level by catering to number of players in a gaming groups. In ArkhamDB, deck authors sometimes are discouraged to create inter-dependent decks with fun inter-investigator combos since the interface is not encouraging it. (The author must explain in the guide and link to the related deck.)

Many casual players would have a lot of fun anticipating cards from each other rather than only playing their own deck to the best of ability. This site has first class support for decks designed to fit each other and **would stop working** without the other deck. (e.g. Became functional only after received a certain card from Teamwork or Untimely Transaction that is illegal in deck building restriction.) They are presented in special way in the deck listing, and the viewing page also has a nicer tab to switch to decks in the same set.

## Rich deckbuilding options presentation

If an investigator has dynamic choice on their deckbuilding requirements, the site will try to analyze your deck, and present the choice taken so beginners can immediately understand the idea even before reading the guide.

For example, the interface can show all the 5 splash cards of Dunwich investigators grouped up together. This is hard-coded per investigator and maybe presented in specialized way all over the site. e.g. Allows searching for Lola deck with a desired class choice, Parallel Roland Banks which used a specific Directive, or Lily Chen that has a specific Discipline.

## Rich Parallel Investigator support

Usage of Parallel Investigator is more obvious in the listing graphics, along with the choice of front and/or back, and whether to use Advanced cards or not.

In ArkhamDB, investigator's signature card are automatically included and cannot be removed even if you intended the deck to work with Advanced version of that card. It can be added but would appear along with the original one (in the main deck or side deck) and maybe confusing to beginners. Here, the UI will try to explain better that Advanced version is preferred in this deck.

## URL includes author's username

The URL is similar to ArkhamDB but now include author's username. Removing everything except author's username reveals all decks of that author, as expected.
